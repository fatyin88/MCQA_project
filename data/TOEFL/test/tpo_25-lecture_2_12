SENTENCE so i just finished reviewing your papers on the influence of nationalism on the composers  music .
SENTENCE and initially i was surprised none of you chose to write about b la bart k ,  that is until i remembered we haven't had a chance to discuss him in class yet .
SENTENCE he was a wonderful and ground breaking composer .
SENTENCE b la bart k was a hungarian ,  whose life stretched from the late nineteenth century to the middle of twentieth century .
SENTENCE but he was not a fan of the romantic style of music that was popular in his homeland during his youth .
SENTENCE wait ,  hungary wasn't a country in 19   ,  was it ?
SENTENCE you are right .
SENTENCE i should have been clear .
SENTENCE bartok was born in austria hungary ,  a nation that broke apart when he was about forty years old .
SENTENCE actually ,  the town where he was born is presently part of romania .
SENTENCE the political history of that region is complex .
SENTENCE suffice to say that bartok is generally known as a hungarian composer .
SENTENCE so during bart k's youth ,  the music played in the concert halls of austria hungary was dominated by romantic pieces by mostly german composers .
SENTENCE we discussed the romantic style last week .
SENTENCE these pieces were long and lyrical .
SENTENCE they were meant to have a sort of grandeur about them .
SENTENCE and in the early 19 's ,  composers who worked in the romantic style were the most popular in austria hungary .
SENTENCE but bartok ,  he was part of the musical community that was trying to change this .
SENTENCE and it led him to    well ,  the first thing it did was lead him to travel                       .
SENTENCE he looked at the countryside for the music of the farmers and the people who lived in small towns ,  and their music ,  well ,  you could say he discovered the music that was popular in those areas .
SENTENCE well ,  all the music we have been talking about the past few weeks ,  it really was all in the cities ,  that's where the composers and the orchestras were .
SENTENCE out in remote areas of the countryside ,  in rural locations ,  music was more traditional ,  the same songs that were enjoyed by previous generations .
SENTENCE bart k went out ,  he travelled to a significant portion of eastern europe actually .
SENTENCE he roamed the countryside and listened to the music heard in small towns and in all sorts of celebrations .
SENTENCE he attended weddings ,  dances and religious ceremonies ,  where he heard a very different sort of music from the romantic stuff being played in the concert halls in the cities .
SENTENCE the music he heard is what we would consider folk music .
SENTENCE and then he had those same songs played in the concert halls ?
SENTENCE no .
SENTENCE at first he went around to document the folk music .
SENTENCE he really wanted to make sure the folk songs were written down before they disappeared .
SENTENCE in fact ,  bart k didn't start out the trip thinking of himself as a composer .
SENTENCE he was an ethnomusicologist .
SENTENCE he studied the traditional music of the region .
SENTENCE but it turns out that what would later have a notable influence on european music on the whole ,  was the way bart k used elements he heard in folk songs in his own compositions .
SENTENCE he adopted a number of elements from what he heard ,  like unusual rhythms .
SENTENCE and he liked to use the glissando as his hallmark ,  which he probably got from listening to croatian folk music .
SENTENCE a glissando is    well ,  i have got a recording of bartok here .
SENTENCE let's wait until the music is fresh in our minds susie ,  do you have something you want to ask first ?
SENTENCE yeah .
SENTENCE before ,  you mention nationalism and ah ,  right ,  yes .
SENTENCE when bartok had his new pieces performed ,  their folk music roots made them instantly popular .
SENTENCE it happened to be a time of strong nationalism in austria hungary ,  so his compositions came at just the right time .
SENTENCE he became very successful there .
SENTENCE particularly ,  when bartok's ballet the wooden prince opened ,  there was great excitement for music that included musical elements from local folk songs ,  music that reflected the region's musical traditions .
SENTENCE however ,  as popular as bartok was in his homeland ,  he did not get much international recognition during his lifetime .
