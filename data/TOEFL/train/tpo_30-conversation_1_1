SENTENCE this is the administrative office ,  right ?
SENTENCE uh huh .
SENTENCE how can i help you ?
SENTENCE well ,  i am stopping by to reserve a place for my school club that meet and work ,  pretty much on a regular basis .
SENTENCE ideally ,  our preference would be to have our own office .
SENTENCE hmm well ,  we are out of private offices .
SENTENCE but we do have some semi private options still available .
SENTENCE well ,  it's a setup where you'll have a larger workspace shared by two other clubs .
SENTENCE in other words ,  each club would have its own work area within that one room .
SENTENCE oh .
SENTENCE are there any divider ,  walls or anything ?
SENTENCE oh ,  yes .
SENTENCE there will be a couple of dividers ,  so there's some privacy .
SENTENCE um .
SENTENCE we'll work with that then .
SENTENCE i wouldn't want to be without an office .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE here are the two forms you have to fill out .
SENTENCE why don't you do it now while i set that up through out computer system .
SENTENCE so what's your club's name ?
SENTENCE and the last name of the club president .
SENTENCE oh ,  it's the photography club .
SENTENCE and it's williams .
SENTENCE that's me .
SENTENCE john williams .
SENTENCE hmm that's not pulling up anything on my screen .
SENTENCE um let me try something else .
SENTENCE uh ,  how about your faculty advisor's name ?
SENTENCE sarah baker .
SENTENCE she is in the arts department .
SENTENCE hmm no .
SENTENCE strange .
SENTENCE you know your club is just not showing up in my online records .
SENTENCE is this an established club ?
SENTENCE no .
SENTENCE actually it's a brand new one .
SENTENCE hmm have you completed the registration process ?
SENTENCE yeah ,  last week .
SENTENCE that was my very first step .
SENTENCE right .
SENTENCE well ,  for my purposes ,  a club definitely has to be registered before i can proceed further .
SENTENCE at the moment ,  however ,  it appears that there's no record of your club's registration .
SENTENCE really ?
SENTENCE i thought everything was finalized last week .
SENTENCE well ,  it is surprising .
SENTENCE usually there's a 24 hour turnaround in our computer database .
SENTENCE so then do you have the registration approval letter from the review committee ?
SENTENCE that would give me the verification i need .
SENTENCE yeah .
SENTENCE i do .
SENTENCE i mean ,  well ,  i don't have it with me .
SENTENCE but   i  i ,  uh ,  can get it from my dorm room ,  bring it back with me and submit it with those forms you need from me .
SENTENCE great !
SENTENCE that'll work .
SENTENCE and just so you are aware ,  there're lots of benefits to being registered .
SENTENCE oh ,  yeah .
SENTENCE i think the university will give us permission to set up a website ,  right ?
SENTENCE i want to get students sharing their ideas on the website ,  you know ,  establish a photography blog .
SENTENCE yes .
SENTENCE you'll be able to do that .
SENTENCE and um actually there's more .
SENTENCE you'll be allowed the use of audiovisual equipment at no cost .
SENTENCE you'll receive a club mailbox and a club email address .
SENTENCE you'll be allowed to post your flyers and posters around the campus for publicity .
SENTENCE and you could be eligible for funding for club events .
SENTENCE well ,  we are definitely interested in hiring a professional speaker at one of our campus events at some point in the semester .
SENTENCE and speakers almost always charge a fee .
SENTENCE so i'll definitely follow up on that .
QUESTION why does the student go to speak with the woman
