SENTENCE hi ,  mark .
SENTENCE what can i do for you ?
SENTENCE i am just filling out this approval for graduation form for the dean's office ,  and i don't know ,  i hope i will be able to graduate next semester .
SENTENCE well ,  as long as you've met the departmental requirements and you submit the form on time ,  you shouldn't have any problem .
SENTENCE make sure you include all the classes you will have taken for your degree in finance and the electives too .
SENTENCE yeah ,  but as i look over the form ,  i got confused because of the way ,  um they've changed the requirements .
SENTENCE so now i am not sure i will be qualified to graduate next semester .
SENTENCE i know i would ,  before ,  under the old requirements .
SENTENCE well ,  when the business department changed the curriculum to include more courses in international business ,  to    well ,  because of the increasing globalization of business .
SENTENCE we made sure that students who have finished their second year ,  that is ,  those who are in their third or fourth year ,  wouldn't be affected .
SENTENCE the new rules only apply to students in their first or second year .
SENTENCE that's good to know .
SENTENCE uh   the department's hiring new faculty too i heard ,  to teach some of the new courses .
SENTENCE but i want to   yes .
SENTENCE one new faculty member has been hired .
SENTENCE she will be teaching international banking as a matter of fact .
SENTENCE actually ,  that's what i want to ask about   international banking .
SENTENCE i took international banking l ,  but i never took international banking 2 .
SENTENCE it used to be that the second semester of international banking was an elective ,  but now it says it's a required class .
SENTENCE yes .
SENTENCE but that's one of the recent changes .
SENTENCE so   oh ,  oh ,  ok .
SENTENCE oh .
SENTENCE and    and i am planning to take a management course next semester ,  but i don't know if it's    if it will count toward my major .
SENTENCE yes .
SENTENCE that will count toward your major .
SENTENCE that's a difficult class ,  you know .
SENTENCE but well worth it .
SENTENCE so it looks like you will have all the required classes you need .
SENTENCE you should be just fine .
SENTENCE uh   i assume you have taken a seminar ?
SENTENCE yeah ,  i took the marketing seminar .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE you are looking good .
SENTENCE just to be on the safe side ,  why don't you talk to someone in the dean's office before you give them the form ?
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE so should i just explain to them that even though one of these classes got changed from an elective to a required class ,  i don't have to take it ?
SENTENCE yes .
SENTENCE you've met the requirements for graduation .
SENTENCE and if there's something i need to do    if i need to write a letter or whatever ,  just let me know .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE thanks .
SENTENCE i'll let you know if i need that letter .
