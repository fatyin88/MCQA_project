SENTENCE hi .
SENTENCE i am tom arnold .
SENTENCE i am supposed to pick up a packet from the regional center for marine research .
SENTENCE i am doing an internship there this summer .
SENTENCE yes .
SENTENCE i have it right here .
SENTENCE the mail carrier dropped it off a few minutes ago .
SENTENCE thanks .
SENTENCE um i wanted to ask about getting credits for the internship .
SENTENCE i don't know if i might be able to help you with that .
SENTENCE is there a problem ?
SENTENCE i just wanted to make sure the details have been corrected .
SENTENCE the system should show that i am registered to earn four credits .
SENTENCE but as of friday ,  nothing was showing up yet .
SENTENCE i was told it would be fixed this morning .
SENTENCE well ,  i can check on the computer for you .
SENTENCE tom arnold ,  right ?
SENTENCE well ,  it is showing credits but only three .
SENTENCE really ?
SENTENCE so now what ?
SENTENCE these all have to be finalized last week .
SENTENCE well ,  yes .
SENTENCE the course enrollment period ended last week .
SENTENCE but since our office was supposed to get this straightened out for you before then  let me see what i can do .
SENTENCE uh did the university give approval for you to earn four credits for this internship ?
SENTENCE because the other students at the center for marine research are only getting three .
SENTENCE um i am pretty sure those other students are doing the internship at the center's aquarium ,  taking classes in marine biology and then teaching visitors about the various displays .
SENTENCE i am doing a special research internship with the center .
SENTENCE we'll be collecting data on changes to the seafloor out in the open ocean .
SENTENCE oh .
SENTENCE that sounds quite advanced .
SENTENCE well ,  the internship requires me to have scuba diving certification and to be a senior oceanography student .
SENTENCE i want to do advanced study in oceanography when i graduate .
SENTENCE so i really want to get a sense of what real research is like .
SENTENCE i see .
SENTENCE now let's try and see if we can  oh .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE i see the problem .
SENTENCE there are two kinds of internships listed here regular and research .
SENTENCE yours is listed as regular so it is only showing three credits .
SENTENCE not yet .
SENTENCE but it lists professor leonard as she is in charge of all the internships .
SENTENCE she just needs to send an email so i have an official record .
SENTENCE then i can switch it .
SENTENCE and that should solve everything .
SENTENCE great !
SENTENCE and i know professor leonard is in her office this afternoon ,  so i can go there later .
SENTENCE it will be such a relief to get all these paperwork completed .
QUESTION what does the student imply about professor leonard
OPTION she is not in charge of oceanography internships 0
OPTION she works at the regional center for marine research 0
OPTION she will be able to help correct the mistake today 1
OPTION she recommended the student for the internship 0
