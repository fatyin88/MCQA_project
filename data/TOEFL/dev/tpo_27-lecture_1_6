SENTENCE so we have been fairly thorough in our discussion about coral reefs ,  which of course are prominent ,  oceanic features made of hard limestone skeletons produced by tiny coral animals .
SENTENCE we've gone over where coral reefs are usually formed   along the edges of shallow ocean banks in tropical or subtropical regions ,  and the fact that they are declining at an alarming rate .
SENTENCE but i don't want to leave you with the impression that all is lost .
SENTENCE there are several techniques being employed today that could prove useful in assuring the future of the reefs .
SENTENCE now ,  we've talked in depth about coral bleaching ,  or whitening ,  which as you recall ,  is a symptom of  well that the coral is suffering .
SENTENCE as you know ,  coral is very sensitive to water temperature .
SENTENCE even though one or two degree celsius rise in sea surface temperature for a relatively short amount of time can cause bleaching .
SENTENCE recently ,  researchers have used data collected by monitoring surface water temperatures to improve the ability of a reef to recover from bleaching .
SENTENCE one future possibility is that improved monitoring can help predict where and when bleaching will occur ,  which might potentially enable us to mitigate its effects .
SENTENCE and there's another technique that's been experimented with to try to help coral reefs recover from bleaching .
SENTENCE it's called coral transplantation .
SENTENCE this involves moving young coral from a healthy reef onto a degraded reef ,  you know ,  in an attempt to regenerate the degraded reef by encouraging young healthy coral to take over .
SENTENCE there has been some success with this ,  but it's still somewhat controversial .
SENTENCE some scientists support it because ,  well for one thing ,  it means you don't have to rely on the existing coral to reestablish itself because it might not be able to .
SENTENCE but in my opinion ,  transplanting coral should only be used as   well as a last resort .
SENTENCE i mean ,  this method is not only costly but it's   well even if it's successful ,  it still fails to address the ongoing problem ,  the root causes of the degradation ,  which really is paramount to devising an effective solution .
SENTENCE so i don't really take comfort in the successes they have had with transplantation .
SENTENCE perhaps some more constructive use of our time could be spent at researching corals that do survive ,  like in areas known as refugia .
SENTENCE refugia are areas on the reef that are seemingly ,  well resistant to bleaching .
SENTENCE see ,  when coral reefs experience bleaching ,  it's rarely a case of the whole reef being affected .
SENTENCE there are almost always pockets of coral on the reefs that remain unaffected .
SENTENCE and these are often the lower areas of the reef ,  those located in deeper water ,  where temperatures are lower .
SENTENCE now ,  we have evidence that corals in these locations are able to escape the destructive bleaching that affects portions of the reef in shallower or warmer water .
SENTENCE so in my mind ,  it's these refugia that are the key components of overall reef resilience .
SENTENCE these should be the area of concentration for researchers to locate and protect those regions as a way to sustain coral reefs .
SENTENCE and we can also protect the reefs by protecting the surrounding ecosystems ,  like mangrove forests and seagrass beds .
SENTENCE both of these grow in coastal waters ,  often in the vicinity of coral reefs .
SENTENCE by protecting these areas ,  we also protect the coral .
SENTENCE let's take ,  for example ,  the mangrove forests .
SENTENCE mangrove root systems have the ability to absorb and well trap sediments and pollutants in water that flows through them before they enter the ocean .
SENTENCE this of course has beneficial results for the nearby coral reefs .
SENTENCE and fishery's management is another key strategy .
SENTENCE overfishing can be seriously disruptive to coral .
SENTENCE let me give you a couple of examples .
SENTENCE overfishing certain species of fish and shellfish like snappers ,  barracudas and even lobsters .
SENTENCE well all of these creatures feed on snails ,  worms and other organisms that eat coral .
SENTENCE so depleting the number of lobsters ,  for example ,  means that we are adding to the threat of coral decline .
SENTENCE sea urchins are another example .
SENTENCE they eat algae and prevent it from overwhelming the coral .
SENTENCE since the disappearance of sea urchins from the waters up the coast of south florida ,  many coral reefs there have been smothered by the uncontrolled growth of algae .
