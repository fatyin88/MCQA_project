SENTENCE so professor tibbits ,  your notes said that you wanted to see me about my hemingway paper .
SENTENCE i have to say that grade wasn't what i was expecting .
SENTENCE i thought i'd done a pretty good job .
SENTENCE oh ,  you did .
SENTENCE but do you really want to settle for pretty good when you can doyou think it can be very good ?
SENTENCE would that mean you'd i could get a better grade ?
SENTENCE oh ,  sorry !
SENTENCE it's not for your grade .
SENTENCE it's i think you could learn a lot by revising it .
SENTENCE you mean ,  rewrite the whole thing ?
SENTENCE i'm really swamped .
SENTENCE there's deadlines wherever i turn and  and i don't really know how much time i could give it .
SENTENCE well ,  it is a busy time ,  with spring break coming up next week .
SENTENCE it's your call .
SENTENCE but i think that with a little extra effort ,  you can really turn this into a fine essay .
SENTENCE no  yeah i mean ,  after i read your comments ,  i  i can see how it tries to doyeah .
SENTENCE it's just too ambitious for the scope of the assignment .
SENTENCE so i should cut out the historical part ?
SENTENCE yes .
SENTENCE i would just stick to the topic .
SENTENCE anything unrelated to the use of nature imagery has no place in the paper .
SENTENCE all that tangential material just distracts from the main argument .
SENTENCE yeah ,  i never know how much to include .
SENTENCE you know where to draw the line ?
SENTENCE tell me about it !
SENTENCE all writers struggle with that one .
SENTENCE but it's something you can learn .
SENTENCE that will become more clear with practice .
SENTENCE but i think if you just cut out the um the stuff about the history ,  but if i cut out those sections ,  won't it be too short ?
SENTENCE well ,  better a short well structured paper than a long paper that's poorly structured and wanders off topic .
SENTENCE so all i have to do is delete those sections ?
SENTENCE well ,  not so fast .
SENTENCE after you cut out those sections ,  you'll have to go back and revise the rest ,  to see how it all fits together .
SENTENCE and of course ,  you'll have to revise the introduction too ,  to accurately describe what you do in the body of the paper .
SENTENCE but that shouldn't be too difficult .
SENTENCE just remember to keep the discussion focused .
SENTENCE do you think you can get it to me by noon tomorrow ?
SENTENCE wow um i have so much er but i'll try .
SENTENCE ok ,  good !
SENTENCE do try !
SENTENCE but if you can't ,  well ,  shoot for after spring break ,  ok ?
