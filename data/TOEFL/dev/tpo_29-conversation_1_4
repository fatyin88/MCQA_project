SENTENCE morning .
SENTENCE how can i help you ?
SENTENCE well ,  i am kind of confused about my schedule .
SENTENCE i printed it out this morning .
SENTENCE but one of the classes i registered for is missing .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE let's see if we can figure this out .
SENTENCE what's your name ?
SENTENCE alright .
SENTENCE i am bringing up your schedule on the computer .
SENTENCE hmmm it looks like you're registered for introduction to astronomy ,  survey of american literature ,  and introduction to government and politics .
SENTENCE well ,  yes ,  but i also registered for a language class level one japanese .
SENTENCE did they i don't know ,  maybe cancel it ?
SENTENCE i doubt it .
SENTENCE the japanese classes are quite popular .
SENTENCE but let's take a look at the list of japanese classes being offered this semester just to make sure .
SENTENCE um  what section did you register for ?
SENTENCE i don't remember the section number .
SENTENCE but it's the one that meets at eleven .
SENTENCE ah !
SENTENCE that would be section five .
SENTENCE well ,  according to this ,  the class is completely full .
SENTENCE are you sure you ,  um ,  you registered online ,  right ?
SENTENCE did you get a confirmation message ?
SENTENCE well ,  once you've successfully registered for a class ,  the computer gives you a message saying you are in .
SENTENCE oh .
SENTENCE you mean that message at the bottom of the screen that says you're now registered for this class ?
SENTENCE actually ,  i didn't get that message .
SENTENCE i got one that said  instructor's signature required .
SENTENCE i thought i just needed to get to professor's signature on the first day of class .
SENTENCE well ,  you do .
SENTENCE but the professor might no sign it .
SENTENCE it depends on how full the class is and how many additional students the professor is willing to let in .
SENTENCE so that means i am not registered for the class .
SENTENCE not unless the professor signs me in .
SENTENCE what ,  uh ,  what should i do now ?
SENTENCE let me give you the form the professor needs to sign .
SENTENCE go to the class on the first day ,  get there early ,  so you can talk to the professor before class starts .
SENTENCE find out if he or she is willing to let you in .
SENTENCE if so ,  bring the signed form back here and we'll register you for the class .
SENTENCE if not ,  well ,  you'll have to find a different class .
SENTENCE i'd start looking for alternatives now ,  just in case .
SENTENCE what do you think my chances are of getting into this class ?
SENTENCE students often add and drop classes once the semester begins ,  so there is a real chance a seat would open up .
SENTENCE but of course there are no guarantees .
SENTENCE it's just that i need a language course to graduate and that's the only japanese class that fits my schedule .
SENTENCE yes .
SENTENCE but according to our records ,  you are only in your first year here .
SENTENCE if you can't take the class this semester ,  you still got time .
SENTENCE i know .
SENTENCE i was just hoping to take care of my requirements earlier rather than later .
SENTENCE i understand .
SENTENCE i just wanted to make sure you know you had options .
QUESTION what does the man suggest the woman do
OPTION put her name on a waiting list 0
OPTION get the professor to sign a form granting her permission to take the class 1
OPTION identify a course she could toke instead of japanese 1
OPTION speak to the head of the japanese department 0
