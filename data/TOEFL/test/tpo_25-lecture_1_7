SENTENCE one consequence of global warming is extinction .
SENTENCE there's compelling evidence that global warming will be a significant driver of many plant and animal extinctions in this century .
SENTENCE so we are considering various strategies to help some threatened species survive this unprecedented ,  this warming trend which ,  as you know ,  is caused mainly by greenhouse gases produced by the burning of fossil fuels .
SENTENCE um   the most radical strategy being debated among conservation biologists is assisted migration .
SENTENCE assisted migration means picking up members of a species ,  or members of a group of interdependent species and physically moving or translocating them .
SENTENCE um   translocating threatened species to a cooler place ,  to higher latitudes or higher elevations ,  for example .
SENTENCE now ,  migration is a natural survival strategy .
SENTENCE over the past two million years ,  colder glacial periods have alternated with warmer interglacial periods .
SENTENCE and so ,  um ,  in response to these gradual climatic swings ,  some species have shifted their ranges hundreds of kilometers .
SENTENCE so perhaps you are wondering why not let nature take its course now ?
SENTENCE well ,  we can't .
SENTENCE the main problem is today's fragmented habitats .
SENTENCE during previous interglacial periods ,  when glaciers retreated ,  they left behind open land in their wakes .
SENTENCE today human development has paved over much of the natural world .
SENTENCE ecosystems are fragmented .
SENTENCE housing developments ,  highways and cities have replaced or sliced through forests and prairies .
SENTENCE there are a few quarters left for species to migrate through without help .
SENTENCE so conservationists are trying to save as many species as possible .
SENTENCE now ,  assisted migration could become a viable part of our rescue strategy ,  but there are a number of uncertainties and risks .
SENTENCE without more research ,  we can't predict if assisted migration will work for any given species .
SENTENCE a translocated species could die out from lack of food ,  for example .
SENTENCE at the other extreme ,  we might successfully translocate the species ,  but within five or ten years that species could proliferate and become an invasive species .
SENTENCE like a non native plant that chokes out native plants by hogging the nutrients in the soil .
SENTENCE translocated animals can become invasive too .
SENTENCE it happened in australia .
SENTENCE the cane toad was introduced back in 1935 to control an insect pest that was destroying australia's sugarcane plantations .
SENTENCE but the cane toad itself became a pest and has destroyed much of the wildlife on that continent .
SENTENCE also ,  many species are interdependent ,  intimately connected to one another .
SENTENCE like animals that eat a certain plant and that plant relies on a certain fungus to help it get nutrients from soil and on a certain insect for pollination .
SENTENCE we probably have to translocate entire networks of species and it's hard to know where to draw the line .
SENTENCE and in addition to all that ,  it is not even clear that assisted migration or any migration for that matter ,  will help at least for some species .
SENTENCE earth was already in one of its warm interglacial periods when we started burning fossil fuels .
SENTENCE and in the twenty first century ,  global temperatures are expected to rise two to six degrees .
SENTENCE that rate of heating is far greater than during the last glacial retreat some 12 ,     years ago .
SENTENCE um    whether to use assisted migration ,  this debate is mostly within the biology community right now .
SENTENCE but the ultimate decision makers ,  in the united states at least ,  will be the government agencies that manage natural resources .
SENTENCE assisted migration really needs this level of oversight ,  and soon .
SENTENCE currently there's no public policy on using assisted migration to help species survive climate change .
SENTENCE people aren't even required to seek permits to move plants or invertebrate animals around as long as they are not classified as pests .
SENTENCE in one case ,  a group of conservationists has already taken it upon itself to try on their own to save an endangered tree ,  the florida torreya tree ,  through assisted migration .
SENTENCE there's only about a thousand individual florida torrey as left .
SENTENCE and global warming is expected to significantly reduce or eliminate this tree's habitat .
SENTENCE so this conservation group wants to translocate seedlings ,  florida torreya seedlings ,  5   kilometers north in order to expand the species  range .
SENTENCE the group believed its effort is justified ,  but i and many other biologists will be watching very closely how this maverick group makes out ,  because like i said ,  there could be unintended consequences .
QUESTION according to the professor, what problem is assisted migration intended to overcome
OPTION to diminishing amount of undeveloped land that species can migrate through 1
OPTION the relative lack of nutrients available in cooler latitudes and higher elevations 0
OPTION the increase in alternations between cool and warm periods 0
OPTION competition from other species in certain native habitats 0
