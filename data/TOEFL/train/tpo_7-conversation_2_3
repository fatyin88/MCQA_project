SENTENCE student hi ,  i am new here and i couldn't come to the student orientation and i'm wondering if you can give me a few quick pointers about the library ?
SENTENCE i'd really appreciate it .
SENTENCE professor  sure .
SENTENCE i'd be glad to .
SENTENCE what's your major area of study ?
SENTENCE professor  ok .
SENTENCE well ,  over here's the section where we have language ,  literature and the arts .
SENTENCE and if you go downstairs you will find the history section .
SENTENCE generally ,  the students who concentrate in latin american literature find themselves researching in the history section a lot .
SENTENCE student um hmm ,  you are right .
SENTENCE i am a transfer student and i've already done a year at another university so i know how the research can go .
SENTENCE i spent a lot of time in the history section .
SENTENCE so how long can i borrow books for ?
SENTENCE professor  our loan period is a month .
SENTENCE oh i should also mention that we have an inter library loan service .
SENTENCE if you need to get hold a book that's not in our library ,  there is a truck that runs between our library and a few other public and university libraries in this area .
SENTENCE it comes around three times a week .
SENTENCE student hey ,  that's great !
SENTENCE at my last school ,  it could take a really long time to get the materials i needed .
SENTENCE so when i had a project ,  i had to make a plan way in advance .
SENTENCE this sounds much faster .
SENTENCE another thing i was wondering is  is there a place where i can bring my computer and hook it up ?
SENTENCE professor  sure .
SENTENCE there is a whole area here on the main floor where you can bring a laptop and plug it in for power but on top of that we also have a connection for the internet at every seat .
SENTENCE student nice ,  so i can do the all research i need to do right here in the library .
SENTENCE i'll have all the resources ,  all the books and the information i need right here in one place .
SENTENCE professor  yeah .
SENTENCE that's the idea .
SENTENCE i am sure you'll need photocopiers too .
SENTENCE there are down the hall to your left .
SENTENCE we have a system where you have to use a copy card so you'll need to buy a card from the front desk .
SENTENCE you insert it into the machine and you are ready to make copies .
SENTENCE student how much do you guys get charge ?
SENTENCE professor  seven cents a copy .
SENTENCE student oh ,  that is not too bad .
SENTENCE thanks .
SENTENCE um ,  where is the collection of rare books ?
SENTENCE professor  rare books are up on the second floor .
SENTENCE they are in a separate room where the temperature is controlled ,  to preserve the old paper in them .
SENTENCE you need to get special permission to access them ,  and then you have to wear gloves to handle them  cause the oils in our hands ,  you know ,  can destroy the paper .
SENTENCE and gloves prevent that so we have a basket of gloves in the room .
SENTENCE student ok .
SENTENCE thanks .
SENTENCE i suppose that's all i need to know .
SENTENCE you've been very helpful .
SENTENCE thanks .
