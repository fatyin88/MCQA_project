SENTENCE well ,  i'm glad you redid your outline .
SENTENCE i fed a few comments ,  but nothing you have to act on .
SENTENCE it's in good enough shape for you to start writing you paper .
SENTENCE thanks !
SENTENCE at first i was afraid all that prep work would be a waste of time .
SENTENCE well ,  especially with a challenging topic like yours  factors leading to the emergence of sociology as an academic discipline .
SENTENCE there's just so much history to consider  you could get lost without a solid outline .
SENTENCE so did you have a question ?
SENTENCE yeah ,  it's about you mentioned needing volunteers for a research study ?
SENTENCE yep ,  it's not my study .
SENTENCE it's my colleague's in the marketing department .
SENTENCE she needs people to watch various new tv programs that haven't been broadcast yet ,  then indicate on a survey whether they liked it ,  why ,  if they'd watch another episode .
SENTENCE it'd be kind of fun plus participants get a  5  gift certificate .
SENTENCE wow ,  well i like the sound of that .
SENTENCE but so they are trying to predict if the shows are gonna succeed or fail ,  right ,  based on students  opinions ?
SENTENCE why would they care what we think ?
SENTENCE hey ,  don't sell yourself short .
SENTENCE people your age are a very attractive market for advertisers who promote their products on television .
SENTENCE the study is sponsored by a tv network .
SENTENCE if enough students don't like the show ,  the network may actually reconsider putting it on the air .
SENTENCE ok ,  well ,  how do i sign up ?
SENTENCE you just add your name and phone number to this list and check a time slot ,  although it looks like the only times left are next monday morning and thursday evening .
SENTENCE oh ,  well ,  i have marketing and economics monday mornings and thursday .
SENTENCE oh ,  you are taking the marketing class ?
SENTENCE who's teaching it ?
SENTENCE it's professor largin   intro to marketing .
SENTENCE hr hasn't mentioned the study though .
SENTENCE oh ,  well ,  the marketing department's pretty big .
SENTENCE i happen to be friends with a woman who is doing the tv study .
SENTENCE ok ,  well ,  we don't want you missing class .
SENTENCE how's thursday ?
SENTENCE oh ,  i work from 5 till 9 that night .
SENTENCE hmm ,  no flexibility with your schedule ?
SENTENCE where do you work ?
SENTENCE oh ,  i like fox's .
SENTENCE i eat there every week .
SENTENCE maybe you could switch shifts with someone .
SENTENCE i'm still in training .
SENTENCE and the only night my trainer works is thursday .
SENTENCE look !
SENTENCE i know the owners there really well .
SENTENCE why don't you let me give them a call and explain the situation ?
SENTENCE ok !
SENTENCE it'd be cool to be part of a real research study .
SENTENCE and the gift certificate wouldn't hurt either .
