SENTENCE so far we have been talking all semester about restoring and preserving pieces of art like ancient frescos early oil paintings etc but although our field is called art conservation it also involves what ?
SENTENCE um   preserving other types of cultural materials toovery good not just art old artifacts are very valuable when they represent early technologies ,  all contain important historical information in fact let me give you an example you've heard about the greek scholar archimedes who lived more than 2     years ago i am sure archimedes was a great mathematician for example he discovered the formula for the volume of a sphere not much of his work has survived but what has survived is brilliant and then in 19 6 a palimpsest of archimedes  writing was discovered now ,  a palimpsest is a type of manuscript that contains writing that's hidden because something else was written over it later i'll explain in a minute this archimedes palimpsest ,  as it's now called is by far the most important palimpsest anyone has ever seen because it contains the only known existing copy of archimedes treatise ,  called method archimedes shows in it how maths can be applied to physics and physical reasoning back to maths problems ,  which is how he calculated the volume of the sphere for example this maybe commonplace today ,  but was revolutionary in his time a few years ago ,  the palimpsest was sold at an auction for 2 million dollars it could have ended up tucked away in a private collection but fortunately ,  the collector who bought it has agreed to have experts restore every single word archimedes wrote so the contents can be shared with the world and studied but there are two main problems what do you think the first one might be ?
SENTENCE um well it sounds like it's extremely old so probably some pages are at the point of crumbling into dust ?
SENTENCE true and some are moldy ,  and some were eaten away at by bookworms this thing's really decayed but on top of that there's another issue and this is the reason why it's a palimpsest you see the text apparently sat around in a library in constantinople until 1229 a'd but then a scribe erased scraped away the writing as clean as he could in order to use the pages to write his own book on why would hedo that ?
SENTENCE take a guess must have been a paper shortage ?
SENTENCE well ?
SENTENCE they used parchment to write on ,  but yes ,  there was a parchment shortage so you are saying the parchment was basically recycled ?
SENTENCE correct then even later on in the twentieth century ,  a forger paintedancient looking pictures on several of the pages in order to make the book seem older and increase its value so unfortunately ,  that's quite a history but professor wilkens if the scribe scraped away archimedes words and if these paintings covered the pages how can the original work be recovered ?
SENTENCE ah ,  that's why i am telling you the story that's our task as conservationists ,  isn't it ?
SENTENCE to find a way there were still faint traces of archimedes words on the pages first we tried to make the archimedes words stand out with a variety of technologies using ultraviolet light but that didn't work on every page but then there was this new idea that came from a scientist studying spinach yes spinach this physicist uwe bergman does research that involves studying iron in spinach he was reading an article about problems with the palimpsest and it said that there is iron in the original archimedes  ink so he came up with an idea to use the same method of looking at iron in spinach to view the iron on the palimpsest pages and his idea worked bergman's technique allows x rays to pass through the forged paintings ,  pass through the scribe's writing to hit the iron traces from the ink of the original archimedes  text and create an image just of the iron on the pages the iron based letters seem to just pop off the page the original text and diagrams emerged line by line diagram after diagram .
SENTENCE and that's kind of typical of our field there's a lot of interdisciplinary work people from several different fields might beinvolved in working with a single art  .
