SENTENCE so ,  i was wondering what i could do to improve my paper before the final draft is due .
SENTENCE well ,  michael ,  i have no problem with your writing style .
SENTENCE it's graceful and clear .
SENTENCE eh ,  and it's interesting that you are writing about your grandmother's piano concert .
SENTENCE yeah ,  when you said we had to attend a concert and write about it ,  i immediately thought of her .
SENTENCE i have been to lots of her concerts .
SENTENCE so i am really familiar with her music .
SENTENCE that's not necessarily an advantage .
SENTENCE familiarity sometimes makes it hard to see things objectively .
SENTENCE so i shouldn't write about my grandmother ?
SENTENCE no ,  no ,  no .
SENTENCE i am just talking in general .
SENTENCE but as i mentioned in my comments ,  i'd like you to place your grandmother's concert in  in a broader context .
SENTENCE yeah ,  i saw that ,  but i wasn't sure what you meant .
SENTENCE i mean ,  i mentioned my grandmother's childhood ,  how much her parents love music ,  how she played the piano at all our family gatherings .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE i see what happened now .
SENTENCE by broader context ,  i mean how the concert relates to some period in music history .
SENTENCE i see .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE um  i have an idea .
SENTENCE well ,  as you read in my paper ,  my grandmother performs classical music .
SENTENCE that's her true love .
SENTENCE but for most of her career ,  she performed jazz .
SENTENCE she originally studied to be a classical pianist .
SENTENCE but jazz was in its heyday back then ,  and when she got out of the conservatory ,  she was invited to join a jazz orchestra .
SENTENCE and the opportunity was just too good to turn down .
SENTENCE really .
SENTENCE well ,  that's fascinating .
SENTENCE because she probably had to reinvent her whole musical style .
SENTENCE she did .
SENTENCE but jazz was where the money was at that time ,  at least for her .
SENTENCE but she eventually went back to classical ?
SENTENCE right .
SENTENCE but only recently .
SENTENCE so if i can show how her choices relate to what was happening in the world of music at the time  ?
SENTENCE i think that might work very nicely .
SENTENCE and if i do that ,  i guess i'll have to like ,  interview her .
SENTENCE and i guess that would mean   you'll have to rewrite most of your paper .
SENTENCE yeah .
SENTENCE would an extra week ease the pain ?
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE so are there other musicians in your family ?
SENTENCE yeah .
SENTENCE my mother plays piano ,  too .
SENTENCE not as well as my grandmother ,  but   i don't play any instruments ,  but i sing in the university choir .
SENTENCE in fact ,  we are performing next week ,  and i have a solo .
SENTENCE that's great !
SENTENCE could i tell the class about your concert ?
SENTENCE um sure .
SENTENCE but about my paper  what question should i be asking my grandmother ?
SENTENCE you know what ,  i have a meeting now .
SENTENCE why don't you come to class a few minutes early tomorrow ?
QUESTION why does the man go to see the professor
