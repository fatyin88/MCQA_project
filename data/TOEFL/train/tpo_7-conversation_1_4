SENTENCE eric  hi ,  professor mason ,  do you have a minute ?
SENTENCE professor  yeah ,  of course ,  eric .
SENTENCE i think there was something i wanted to talk to you about too .
SENTENCE eric  probably my late essay .
SENTENCE professor  ah ,  that must be it .
SENTENCE i thought maybe i've lost it .
SENTENCE eric  no ,  i'm sorry .
SENTENCE actually it was my computer that lost it ,  the first draft of it .
SENTENCE and ,  well ,  anyway ,  i finally put it in your mailbox yesterday .
SENTENCE professor  oh , and i haven't checked the mailbox yet today .
SENTENCE well ,  i'm glad it's there .
SENTENCE i will read it this weekend .
SENTENCE eric  well ,  sorry again .
SENTENCE say ,  i can send it to you by email too if you like .
SENTENCE professor  great .
SENTENCE i'll be interested to see how it all came out .
SENTENCE eric  right .
SENTENCE now ,  um ,  i just have overheard some graduate students  talking ,  something about a party for dean adams ?
SENTENCE professor  retirement party ,  yes ,  all students are invited .
SENTENCE wasn't there notice on the anthropology department's bulletin board ?
SENTENCE eric  uh ,  i don't know .
SENTENCE but i want to offer help out with it .
SENTENCE you know whatever you need .
SENTENCE dean adams ,  well ,  i took a few anthropology classes with her and they were great ,  inspiring .
SENTENCE that's why i want to pitch in .
SENTENCE professor  oh ,  that's very thoughtful of you ,  eric ,  but it will be pretty low key ,  nothing flashy .
SENTENCE that's not her style .
SENTENCE professor  no ,  we'll have coffee and cookies ,  maybe a cake .
SENTENCE but actually a couple of the administrative assistants are working on that .
SENTENCE you could ask them but i think they've got covered .
SENTENCE professor  actually ,  oh ,  no ,  never mind .
SENTENCE professor  well ,  it's nothing to do with the party and i'm sure there are more exciting ways that you could spend your time .
SENTENCE but we do need some help with something .
SENTENCE we're compiling a database of articles the anthropology faculty has published .
SENTENCE there is not much glory in it ,  but we are looking for someone with some knowledge of anthropology who can enter the articles .
SENTENCE i hesitate to mention it .
SENTENCE but i don't suppose this is something you would .
SENTENCE eric  no ,  that sounds kind of cool .
SENTENCE i would like to see what they are writing about .
SENTENCE professor  wonderful .
SENTENCE and there are also some unpublished studies .
SENTENCE did you know dean adams did a lot of field research in indonesia ?
SENTENCE most of it hasn't been published yet .
SENTENCE eric  no ,  like what ?
SENTENCE professor  well ,  she is really versatile .
SENTENCE she just spent several months studying social interactions in indonesia and she's been influential in ethnology .
SENTENCE oh ,  and she's also done work in south of america ,  this is closer to biology ,  especially with speciation .
SENTENCE eric  uh ,  not to seem uninformed .
SENTENCE professor  well ,  how species form .
SENTENCE you know ,  how two distinct species form from one .
SENTENCE like when populations of the same species are isolated from each other and then develop into two different directions and end up as two distinct species .
SENTENCE professor  yes ,  and while she was there in south america ,  she collected a lot of linguistic information and songs ,  really fascinating .
SENTENCE eric  well .
SENTENCE i hate to see her leave .
SENTENCE professor  don't worry .
SENTENCE she'll still be around .
SENTENCE she's got lots of projects that she's still in the middle of .
QUESTION why does the professor talk about speciation
