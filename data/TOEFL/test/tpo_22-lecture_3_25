SENTENCE a mass extinction as when numerous species become extinct over a very short time period ,  short ,  geologically speaking that is ,  like when the dinosaurs died out 65 million years ago .
SENTENCE and the fossil record ,  it indicates that in all the time that animals have inhabited earth ,  there have been five great mass extinctions ,  dinosaurs being the most recent .
SENTENCE in each of the others up to half of all land animals and up to 95 percent of marine species disappeared .
SENTENCE well ,  today we are witnessing a sixth mass extinction ,  but unlike the others ,  the current loss of bio diversity can be traced to human to human activity .
SENTENCE since the stone age ,  humans have been eliminating species and altering ecosystems with astounding speed .
SENTENCE countless species have disappeared due to over hunting ,  habitat destruction and habitat fragmentation ,  pollution and other unnatural human causes .
SENTENCE so ,  as a way of repairing some of that damage ,  a group of conservation biologists has proposed an ambitious ,  or some might say ,  a radical plan ,  involving large vertebrates ,  or  ,  megafauna .
SENTENCE megafauna include elephants ,  wild horses ,  big cats ,  camels ,  large animals .
SENTENCE eh ,  actually ,  the proposal focuses on a particular subset of megafauna ,  the kind that lived during the pleistocene epoch .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE the pleistocene epoch ,  most commonly known as the ice age ,  stretched from 1 .
SENTENCE 8 million to 11 , 5   years ago .
SENTENCE in the americas ,  many megafauna began disappearing by the end of the pleistocene .
SENTENCE so here's the biologists  idea .
SENTENCE take a select group of animals ,  megafauna from places like africa and asia ,  and introduce them into other ecosystems similar to their current homes ,  beginning in the united states .
SENTENCE they call their plan pleistocene rewilding .
SENTENCE now ,  the advocates of pleistocene rewilding cite two main goals .
SENTENCE one is to help prevent the extinction of some endangered megafauna by providing new refuges ,  new habitats for them .
SENTENCE the other is to restore some of the evolutionary and ecological potential that has been lost in north america .
SENTENCE what do i mean by restore evolutionary potential ?
SENTENCE well as you know the evolution of any species is largely influenced by its interactions with other species .
SENTENCE so during the pleistocene epoch  let's take the now extinct american cheetah ,  for instance .
SENTENCE we believe it played a pivotal role in the evolution of the pronghorn antelope ,  the antelope's amazing speed ,  to be exact ,  because natural selection would favor those antelope that could outrun a cheetah .
SENTENCE when the american cheetahs disappeared ,  their influence on the evolution of pronghorn and presumably on other prey animals stopped .
SENTENCE so it is conceivable that the pronghorn antelope would have continued to evolve ,  get faster maybe ,  if the cheetahs were still around .
SENTENCE that's what's meant by evolutionary potential .
SENTENCE importing african cheetahs to the western united states could ,  in theory ,  put the pronghorn back onto its  uh ,  natural evolutionary trajectory according to these biologists .
SENTENCE another example is the interaction of megafauna with local flora ,  in particular ,  plants that rely on animals to disperse their seeds .
SENTENCE like pleistocene rewilding could spark the re emergence of large seeded american plants ,  such as the maclura tree .
SENTENCE many types of maclura used to grow in north american ,  buy today ,  just one variety remains and it is found in only two states .
SENTENCE in the distant past ,  large herbivores like mastodons dispersed maclura seeds ,  each the size of an orange in their droppings .
SENTENCE well ,  there aren't any mastodons left ,  but there are elephants ,  which descended from mastodons .
SENTENCE introduce elephants into that ecosystem and they might disperse those large maclura seeds ,  like their ancestors did .
SENTENCE get the idea ?
SENTENCE restoring some of the former balance to the ecosystem ?
SENTENCE but as i alluded to earlier ,  pleistocene rewilding is extremely controversial .
SENTENCE a big worry is that these transplanted megafauna might devastate plants and animals that are native to the western united states .
SENTENCE in the years since the pleistocene epoch ,  native species have adapted to the changing environmental there ,  plants ,  smaller animals ,  they have been evolving without megafauna for millennia .
SENTENCE also ,  animal species that went extinct 11 ,     years ago ,  uh ,  some are quite different genetically from their modern day counterparts ,  like elephants don't have thick coasts like their mastodon ancestors do when they graze the prairies of the america west during the ice age .
SENTENCE granted ,  the climate today is not as cold as it was in the pleistocene .
SENTENCE but winters on the prairie can still get pretty harsh today .
SENTENCE and there are many more considerations .
SENTENCE well ,  you see how complex this is .
SENTENCE if you think about it though ,  the core problem with this sixth mass extinction is human interference .
SENTENCE pleistocene rewilding is based on good intentions ,  but you know ,  it probably would just be more of the same thing .
QUESTION according to the professor , how did the american cheetah influence the pronghorn antelope during the pleistocene epoch
OPTION the cheetah prevented the antelope's population from growing too large 0
OPTION the cheetah was a factor in the development of the antelope's speed 1
OPTION the cheetah dispersed the seeds of plants that the antelope needed to survive 0
OPTION the cheetah caused the antelope to migrate out of the western united states 0
