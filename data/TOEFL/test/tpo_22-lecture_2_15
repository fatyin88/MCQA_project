SENTENCE today ,  i want to talk about a paradox the ties in with the topic we discuss last time .
SENTENCE we were discussing the geological evidence of water ,  liquid water on earth and mars three to four billion years ago .
SENTENCE so ,  what evidence of a liquid water environment did we find in rock samples taking from the oldest rocks on earth ?
SENTENCE eh  like pebbles ,  fossilized algae ?
SENTENCE right .
SENTENCE and on mars ?
SENTENCE good .
SENTENCE all evidence of water in liquid form ,  large quantities of it .
SENTENCE now ,  remember when we talked about star formation ,  we said that as a star ages ,  it becomes brighter ,  right ?
SENTENCE hydrogen turns into helium ,  which releases energy .
SENTENCE so our standard model of star formation suggests that the sun wasn't nearly as bright three to four billion years ago as it is today ,  which means the temperatures on earth and mars would have been lower ,  which in turn suggests   there would have been ice on earth or mars ?
SENTENCE correct .
SENTENCE if the young sun was much fainter and cooler than the sun today ,  liquid water couldn't have existed on either planet .
SENTENCE now ,  this apparent contradiction between geologic evidence and the stellar evolution model became known as the faint young sun paradox .
SENTENCE now ,  there have been several attempts to solve this paradox .
SENTENCE first ,  there was the greenhouse gas solution .
SENTENCE well ,  you are probably familiar with the greenhouse gas effect ,  so i won't go into details now .
SENTENCE the idea was that trapped greenhouse gases in the atmospheres of earth and mars might have caused temperatures to raise enough to compensate for the low heat the young sun provided .
SENTENCE and so it would have been warm enough on these planets for liquid water to exist .
SENTENCE so ,  what gas do you think was the first suspect in causing the greenhouse effect ?
SENTENCE um carbon dioxide ,  i guess .
SENTENCE like today ?
SENTENCE in fact ,  studies indicate that four billion years ago ,  carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere were much higher than today's levels .
SENTENCE but the studies also indicate that they weren't high enough to do the job make up for a faint sun .
SENTENCE then some astronomers came up with the idea that atmospheric ammonia might have acted as a greenhouse gas .
SENTENCE but ammonia would have been destroyed by the ultra violet light coming from the sun and it had to be ruled out too .
SENTENCE another solution ,  which is proposed much later ,  was that perhaps the young sun wasn't faint at all ,  perhaps it was bright .
SENTENCE so it is called the bright young sun solution ,  according to which the sun would have provided enough heat for the water on earth and mars to be liquid .
SENTENCE but how could the early sun be brighter and hotter than predicted by the standard model ?
SENTENCE well ,  the answer is mass .
SENTENCE you mean the sun had more mass when it was young ?
SENTENCE well ,  if the young sun was more massive than today's ,  it would have been hotter and brighter than the model predicts .
SENTENCE but this would mean that it had lost mass over the course of four billion years .
SENTENCE actually ,  the sun is constantly losing mass through the solar wind ,  a stream of charged particles constantly blowing off the sun .
SENTENCE we know the sun's current rate of mass loss ,  but if we assume that this rate has been steady over the last four billion years ,  the young sun wouldn't have been massive enough to have warmed earth ,  let alone mars ,  not enough to have caused liquid water .
SENTENCE maybe the solar wind was stronger then ?
SENTENCE there is evidence that the solar wind was more intense in the past .
SENTENCE but we don't know for sure how much mass our sun's lost over the last four billion years .
SENTENCE astronomers tried to estimate what solar mass could produce the required luminosity to explain liquid water on these planets .
SENTENCE they also took into account that with a more massive young sun ,  the planets would be closer to the sun than they are today .
SENTENCE and they found that about seven percent more mass would be required .
SENTENCE so the young sun had seven percent more mass than our sun ?
SENTENCE well ,  we don't know .
SENTENCE according to observations of young sun like stars ,  our sun may have lost as much as six percent of its initial mass ,  which doesn't quite make it .
SENTENCE on the other hand ,  this estimate is based on a small sample .
SENTENCE and the bright young sun solution is appealing .
SENTENCE we simply need more data to determine the mass loss rate of stars .
SENTENCE so there's reason to believe that we will get an answer to that piece of the puzzle one day .
QUESTION why does the professor mention the solar wind
OPTION to explain a way the sun is losing mass 1
OPTION to point out that it was less intense billions of years ago 0
OPTION to suggest a reason for early climate differences between earth and mars 0
OPTION to explain the importance of solving the faint young sun paradox 0
