SENTENCE egyptian hieroglyphs are the ancient egyptian writings found in ancient egypt on walls ,  monuments and on the inside and outside of temples .
SENTENCE hieroglyphic writing ended abruptly about 16   years ago .
SENTENCE and it mystified the mot brilliant minds in the study of egyptian artifacts and archaeology for many many centuries .
SENTENCE finally ,  the possiblity of deciphering hieroglyphs came about with the discovery ,  in 1799 ,  of the rosetta stone .
SENTENCE the rosetta stone is arguably the most famous archaeological artifact ever discovered .
SENTENCE it contains the same exact text written in three different alphabets  greek ,  demotic ,  hieroglyphic .
SENTENCE but we didn't even know at first that the three texts on the rosetta stone contain the same information .
SENTENCE and two of the three alphabets are ancient egyptian scripts that stop being used  the hieroglyphic and the demotic the demotic script found on the rosetta stone ,  well ,  demotic was not as elaborate as hieroglyphic writing .
SENTENCE it was used for more mundane matters ,  oh ,  like administrative documents .
SENTENCE these ancient egyptian scripts were replaced by coptic scripts .
SENTENCE but eventually ,  the arabic language replaced coptic and this cut off the linguistic link between ancient and modern egypt .
SENTENCE now ,  the rosetta stone was remarkable because as i said ,  on it ,  was the same text in three different alphabets  greek ,  demotic and hieroglyphic .
SENTENCE the stone was essentially the dictionary that scholars needed to interpret the meaning of the hieroglyphs .
SENTENCE and it took a uniquely equipped researcher to finally decipher and understand what was written on the stone .
SENTENCE thomas young ,  an english scholar ,  was the first to seriously attempt to decipher the symbols on the rosetta stone .
SENTENCE he suspected rightly that the hieroglyphs were phonetic symbols ,  that they represented its sounds rather than pictures .
SENTENCE until then ,  all scholars assumed that hieroglyphs were pictographs ,  that they symbolize objects or concepts .
SENTENCE thomas young focused his attention on one set of hieroglyphs that he thought would probably spell out a single word  the name of a king or queen .
SENTENCE he guessed that the symbols represented the name of the early egyptian ruler ptolemy ,  since ptolemy was also written in greek on the stone and was indeed a greek name .
SENTENCE and young did actually prove that these hieroglyphs represented sounds rather than whole words .
SENTENCE strangely though ,  he gave into the dominant thesis of the day that hieroglyphs were pictographs .
SENTENCE he actually dismissed his own findings as an anomaly because the ptolemaic dynasty was greek ,  not egyptian .
SENTENCE in other words ,  he figured it was an exception to the rule .
SENTENCE it was phonetic because it was greek ,  not egyptian .
SENTENCE how else could an egyptian depict a greek name other than spell it out ?
SENTENCE and that brings us to the hero of our story  jean francois champollion .
SENTENCE champollion built on young's work ,  showing that different hieroglyphs spelled the names of kings and queens like alexander or cleopatra .
SENTENCE but his critics noted that this was still not traditional egyptian names .
SENTENCE he hadn't done any more than young had been able to do ,  so he couldn't disprove the dominant theory .
SENTENCE then in 1822 ,  champollion was shown a set of hieroglyphs that contain traditional egyptian names .
SENTENCE the first two of these symbols were unknown ,  but champollion knew that the repeated hieroglyphs to the far right symbolized an 's  sound .
SENTENCE he then drew on his linguistic knowledge to arrive at the solution to the problem .
SENTENCE you see ,  unlike any of the other scholars who had tried to crack the code ,  champollion happened to be fluent in coptic .
SENTENCE he wondered ,  and this was the real breakthrough ,  if coptic was the language symbolized by the hieroglyphs on the rosetta stone .
SENTENCE and if so ,  then perhaps that first disc shape symbol might represent the sun .
SENTENCE and the coptic word for sun is  ra  .
SENTENCE see where this is headed ?
SENTENCE so if the symbol were coptic ,  the first symbol would be  ra  .
SENTENCE and then an unknown symbol followed by a double 's  sound .
SENTENCE was this ,  champollion wondered ,  the name rameses1 ?
SENTENCE he was eventually able to confirm that it was .
SENTENCE so ,  he had figured it out .
SENTENCE hieroglyphs were mainly phonetic ,  they represented sounds ,  not pictures ,  and the underlying language was coptic .
SENTENCE a lot of work remained ,  but champollion had cracked the code .
