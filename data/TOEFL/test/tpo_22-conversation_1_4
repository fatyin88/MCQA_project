SENTENCE hi ,  i am sorry to bother you ,  but   this is about the newspaper .
SENTENCE oh ,  ok .
SENTENCE well .
SENTENCE i am only the advisor  the newspaper office is off campus on pine street .
SENTENCE eh what was it ?
SENTENCE did you want to work for the paper ?
SENTENCE we are always looking for writers .
SENTENCE well ,  my problem was with the writing actually ,  with an article that was published in yesterday's newspaper .
SENTENCE the one about the  government and its president sally smith .
SENTENCE is this something to do with what the editor wrote about the statue ?
SENTENCE eh ,  the statue at the main entrance of the university ?
SENTENCE well ,  that's part of it .
SENTENCE but you know ,  the editor used the situation to say some really unfair things ,  about the  government ,  and the president sally smith in particular .
SENTENCE i think the paper should publish a retraction ,  or at the very least an apology to sally .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE um  if i remember correctly ,  what you are referring to wasn't a news story ,  but an editorial ,  right ?
SENTENCE eh ,  it was on the opinion page ,  it was signed by one of the editors ,  and was clearly labeled as commentary .
SENTENCE well ,  yes .
SENTENCE but the thing about the statue ,  sally made this simple comment that was in really bad condition and should be replaced .
SENTENCE and ,  well ,  the tone in the editorial was demeaning .
SENTENCE it accused her of not respecting the past and it had some personal stuff that seemed unnecessary .
SENTENCE wait a minute .
SENTENCE remind me .
SENTENCE well ,  you know ,  it implied that sally doesn't know much about the university's history and it called her a big city politician because she's from boston .
SENTENCE it's just mean spirited ,  isn't it ?
SENTENCE haven't you heard the saying  all publicity is good publicity  ?
SENTENCE i'd say the article is bringing attention to the  government organization ,  which is pretty invisible .
SENTENCE eh ,  you rarely hear about what the student government is doing .
SENTENCE and the piece ,  well ,  yeah ,  it had a bit of an exaggerated tone .
SENTENCE it was satirical ,  or at least it was meant to be .
SENTENCE it wasn't just poking fun at sally ,  but the whole idea that our school is sort of rural ,  and you know ,  not cosmopolitan .
SENTENCE well ,  none of us thought it was very funny .
SENTENCE well ,  sometimes it's best just to roll with it .
SENTENCE it is just a clich   everybody knows it is not true .
SENTENCE but i thought we could expect better than that here .
SENTENCE well ,  i am certainly in favor of getting a variety of viewpoints .
SENTENCE [so why don't you go talk to the editor ,  jennifer hamilton ,  and tell her you want equal time ?
SENTENCE you or sally could write a response . ]
SENTENCE [really ?
SENTENCE she would let us do that ?  ]
SENTENCE didn't she write it ?
SENTENCE i'll let jennifer know you are coming ,  she feels the same way i do .
SENTENCE she is journalism major .
SENTENCE she would be happy to publish another point of view .
