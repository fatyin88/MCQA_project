SENTENCE excuse me ,  can i help you ?
SENTENCE you look a little lost .
SENTENCE yeah ,  i am .
SENTENCE this is my first day on campus ,  and i don't know where anything is .
SENTENCE can't find your orientation session ?
SENTENCE uh huh .
SENTENCE what a way to begin !
SENTENCE lost going to orientation well ,  my guess is in the auditorium ,  that's where they usually are .
SENTENCE you're right ,  the general ones .
SENTENCE i went to one of those sessions ealier today .
SENTENCE but now i need the one for my major ,  engineering .
SENTENCE my schedule says the meeting room is in    johnson hall ?
SENTENCE in the engineering department ,  which should be right here in front of us ,  according to the map .
SENTENCE but this building is called the morgan hall .
SENTENCE well ,  your map reading skills are fine actually .
SENTENCE this used to be johnson hall ,  all right .
SENTENCE trouble is they changed the name to morgan hall last spring .
SENTENCE so they sent you a map with an old name ?
SENTENCE i am surprised .
SENTENCE well ,  this was actually mailed out month and month ago .
SENTENCE i got a second pack in the mail more recently with another one of these maps in it .
SENTENCE i guess they must have the updated name .
SENTENCE i left that one in my dorm room .
SENTENCE well ,  things change fast around here .
SENTENCE this building was renamed after one of our professors .
SENTENCE she retired a few months ago .
SENTENCE she is very well known in the world of physics .
SENTENCE too bad for johnson ,  i guess .
SENTENCE oh ,  one of the early professors here .
SENTENCE unfortunately ,  i thinks his ideas are going out of style .
SENTENCE science kept marching forward .
SENTENCE i'll say it does .
SENTENCE that's why i transferred to this university .
SENTENCE i was really impressed with all the research equipment you guys have at the laboratories .
SENTENCE you are really on the forefront .
SENTENCE um   so do you know what kind of engineering you want to specialize in ?
SENTENCE well ,  the aerospace engineering department here is excellent !
SENTENCE eh   do you know that this university was the first one in the country to offer a program in aerospace engineering ?
SENTENCE yeah ,  i know .
SENTENCE and a couple of students who graduated from here became astronauts and orbited the earth .
SENTENCE right .
SENTENCE the department has many prominent alumni .
SENTENCE well ,  you might end up taking some of your advanced math course with me .
SENTENCE i get a lot of students from the engineering department because i teach the required applied mathematics courses .
SENTENCE oh ,  cool .
SENTENCE actually ,  i want to get a minor in math .
SENTENCE excellent .
SENTENCE hmm   a major in aerospace engineering with a minor in math ,  you'll go far with that degree .
SENTENCE more of our students should do that .
SENTENCE there are so many more opportunities available in the field when you have a strong math background .
SENTENCE i'm glad to hear you say that .
QUESTION what is man's attitude toward his new university
OPTION he is impressed by the architecture of the buildings 0
OPTION he does not value its long tradition in aerospace engineering 0
OPTION he thinks it needs a more efficient orientation program 0
OPTION he believes it will help him become successful in his chosen field 1
