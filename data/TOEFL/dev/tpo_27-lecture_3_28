SENTENCE your reading for today touched on dinosaur fossils from the mesozoic era ,  which ended about 65 million years ago .
SENTENCE today we will be discussing the sauropods .
SENTENCE i think our discussion of sauropods will illustrate what we can learn by comparing the fossil record to modern animals .
SENTENCE by fossils ,  we mean traces of prehistoric animals such as bones ,  which become mineralized ,  or impressions of bones or organs that are left in stone .
SENTENCE now sauropods were among the largest animals to exist ever !
SENTENCE they were larger than blue whales ,  which are the largest animals alive today .
SENTENCE they weigh up to one hundred tons ,  twenty times as much as elephants .
SENTENCE also ,  they were an extremely successful kind of dinosaur .
SENTENCE there's evidence of sauropods in the fossil record for an unusually long time ,  over one hundred million years .
SENTENCE so ,  why were sauropods so successful ?
SENTENCE biologically speaking ,  sauropods shouldn't have been successful .
SENTENCE large animals like elephants ,  say ,  they require much more food and energy and have fewer offspring than smaller animals .
SENTENCE this makes maintaining a population harder .
SENTENCE the largest animals today don't live on land .
SENTENCE but in the ocean where food is easier to find ,  a blue whale ,  for instance ,  can eat up to 8 ,     pounds of food a day .
SENTENCE and they give birth only once every few years .
SENTENCE we also know that body heat ,  that  well ,  large animals can't easily get rid of excess body heat .
SENTENCE but for an oceangoing whale ,  that's not a problem .
SENTENCE for a 1   ton land animal ,  it can be .
SENTENCE for years ,  we have assumed it was the abundant plant life of the mesozoic that allowed these giants to thrive .
SENTENCE however ,  we now know that since oxygen levels were much lower in the mesozoic than we assumed ,  there was much less plant life for sauropods to eat than we thought .
SENTENCE so now ,  well ,  we are looking at other  we are ,  we are trying to understand the biology of sauropods ,  comparing their fossils to the anatomy of modern animals to get a better idea of how they lived .
SENTENCE what we've found is that sauropods were experts at conserving energy .
SENTENCE they had enormous stomach capacity ,  the ability to digest food over a long period ,  converting it to energy at a slower pace ,  saving it for later .
SENTENCE for animals with small stomachs ,  it takes lots of energy to constantly look for food and then digest it .
SENTENCE with larger stomachs and slower digestion ,  you don't need as much energy .
SENTENCE joseph ?
SENTENCE does  do scientists actually know about sauropods from looking at  i mean ,  how much can we actually learn looking at some ancient bones compared to all we can learn from modern animals ?
SENTENCE and ,  comparisons between animals that lived millions of years apart ?
SENTENCE well ,  it just seems  more like guessing .
SENTENCE there's always some guesswork when studying extinct animals .
SENTENCE but that's exactly what leads to discoveries ,  a hypothesis ,  a type of guess is made .
SENTENCE we guess the hypothesis by looking for evidence to support it .
SENTENCE then some questions are answered ,  which may lead to new questions .
SENTENCE for example ,  let's look at one of these comparisons .
SENTENCE we know sauropods couldn't chew food .
SENTENCE their skulls show they had no chewing muscles .
SENTENCE lots of modern animals ,  like birds and reptiles ,  also can't chew food .
SENTENCE they need to swallow it whole .
SENTENCE but modern animals have an interesting aid for digesting food .
SENTENCE they swallow stones ,  stones that are used to help grind up the food before it's actually digested in the stomach .
SENTENCE these stones are called gastroliths .
SENTENCE gastroliths make food easier to digest ,  essentially smashing food up ,  just as we do when we chew .
SENTENCE over time ,  gastroliths inside the animal are ground down and become smooth and rounded .
SENTENCE now ,  sauropod fossils are commonly found with smooth stones .
SENTENCE for years we thought these were gastroliths .
SENTENCE they look just like gastroliths and were found in the area of the sauropods  stomachs .
SENTENCE a recent study measured the gastroliths in modern animals ,  in ostriches .
SENTENCE and the study showed that ostriches need to ingest about one percent of their total body weight in gastroliths .
SENTENCE but we have been able to determine that the stones found with sauropods totaled much less proportionally ,  less than a tenth of one percent of their body weight .
SENTENCE so now we are not quite sure what these sauropods  stones were used for .
SENTENCE it could be they were accidently ingested as the sauropods foraged for food ,  that they served no real purpose .
SENTENCE other researchers speculate that sauropods ingested these stones as a source of some the minerals they needed ,  such as calcium .
SENTENCE so the original hypothesis that the stones found with sauropods were gastroliths ,  even though it hasn't been supported ,  has helped us to make new hypotheses ,  which may eventually lead to the answer .
QUESTION what did researchers conclude from their study of sauropods and gastroliths
OPTION that gastroliths probably helped sauropods to store large quantities of plant material in their stomachs 0
OPTION that sauropods probably used gastroliths to conserve energy 0
OPTION that sauropods may not have used gastroliths to aid their digestion 1
OPTION that sauropods probably did not ingest any stones 0
