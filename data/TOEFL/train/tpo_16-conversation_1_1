SENTENCE hi .
SENTENCE i'm melanie ,  the one who's been calling .
SENTENCE from the singing group ,  right ?
SENTENCE right ,  the choir .
SENTENCE it's nice to finally meet you in person .
SENTENCE so ,  you are having problems with .
SENTENCE noise .
SENTENCE like i explained on the phone we've always had our rehearsals in the lincoln auditorium every day at 3 o clock and it's always worked just great .
SENTENCE but the past few weeks with the noise ,  it's been a total nightmare since construction started next door on the science hall .
SENTENCE oh ,  that's right .
SENTENCE they're building that addition for new laboratories .
SENTENCE exactly .
SENTENCE anyway ,  ever since they started working on it ,  it's been so noisy we can barely hear ourselves think .
SENTENCE forget about singing .
SENTENCE i mean ,  we keep the windows down and everything ,  but once those bulldozers get going ,  i mean those machines are loud .
SENTENCE we've already had to cut short two rehearsals and we've got a concert in 6 weeks .
SENTENCE well ,  that's not good .
SENTENCE i'm assuming you've tried to reschedule your rehearsals .
SENTENCE they don't do construction work at night .
SENTENCE i ran that by the group ,  but there were just too many   i mean evenings are really hard .
SENTENCE it seems like everyone in the choir already has plans and some even have classes at night .
SENTENCE and what about the music building ?
SENTENCE you know ,  originally we were booked in one of the rehearsal rooms in the music building ,  but then we switched with the jazz ensemble .
SENTENCE they're a much smaller group and they said the acoustics ,  the sound in that room ,  was better for them .
SENTENCE so having us move to a bigger space like the lincoln auditorium seemed like a reasonable idea .
SENTENCE all that noise .
SENTENCE i don't know .
SENTENCE i just wonder if the jazz ensemble knew what was going to happen .
SENTENCE well ,  that wouldn't be very nice .
SENTENCE no .
SENTENCE but it really was quite a coincidence .
SENTENCE anyway ,  now the music building's fully booked ,  mornings ,  afternoons ,  everything ,  we just need a quiet space .
SENTENCE and it has to have a piano .
SENTENCE a piano .
SENTENCE of course some of the other auditoriums have pianos ,  but that's not going to beyou think they're pretty booked up ?
SENTENCE probably .
SENTENCE but it can't hurt to check .
SENTENCE what about bradford hall ?
SENTENCE i remember a piano inthe old student center there .
SENTENCE at this point ,  we'd be grateful for any quiet place .
SENTENCE can you   how flexible can you be on times ?
SENTENCE you said no evenings ,  but what if can't find something open at 3 o clock ?
SENTENCE can you move earlier or later ?
SENTENCE i wish i could say another time would be okay ,  but you know how it is ,  everybody's already got commitments for the whole semester .
SENTENCE 2 3  or 3 3  would probably be okay ,  but i don't think we could go much outside thatwell ,  check with me tomorrow morning .
SENTENCE i should've found something by then .
SENTENCE it mightas long as it's got a piano and nobody's putting up a building next door ,  we'll be happy .
