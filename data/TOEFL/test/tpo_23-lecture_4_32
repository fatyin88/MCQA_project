SENTENCE now ,  when you think about choreography ,  well ,  uh ,  for your last assignment ,  you choreographed the dance that was performed on stage in front of live audience .
SENTENCE now ,  screen dance is very different .
SENTENCE it is a dance routine you will be choreographing specifically to be viewed on a screen ,  on a computer screen ,  a tv screen ,  in a movie theater ,  any screen .
SENTENCE so the question we have to ask is ,  what's the difference between choreography for a live performance and choreography for on screen viewing ?
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE think for a minute .
SENTENCE when you see a movie ,  is it just a film of people acting on a stage ?
SENTENCE of course not .
SENTENCE movies use a variety of camera angles and creative editing .
SENTENCE movies can distort time ,  slow movement down ,  or speed it up ,  show actors fading in and out of scenes ,  etc .
SENTENCE all of these  ?
SENTENCE all of these film making techniques ,  things that can't be used in a live performance ,  are possible in a screen dance .
SENTENCE now ,  we'll cover these concepts in greater detail later ,  but you should be getting the idea that i don't want you to just film dancers on stage and turn it in as your screen dance project .
SENTENCE uh ,  yes ?
SENTENCE debbie .
SENTENCE but isn't something lost here ,  professor watson ?
SENTENCE i am a dancer ,  and when i perform on stage ,  i am so energized by the audience's reactions ,  the applause .
SENTENCE i actually ,  and for a lot of dancers ,  it  ?
SENTENCE it really inspires us .
SENTENCE you're right .
SENTENCE screen dance ,  which is a relatively new ,  isn't for everyone .
SENTENCE uh ,  some dancers may seem reluctant to participate in your project ,  because they do thrive on the immediacy of performing live .
SENTENCE if this happens ,  you could point out that screen dance offers other ways for dancers to connect to their audience .
SENTENCE for example ,  dancers can express themselves ,  even change the whole mood of the scene through a facial expression .
SENTENCE and you could film close up shots of their faces .
SENTENCE facial expressions aren't as important in live performances generally ,  because the choreographer knows that someone in the back row of a theater may not be able to see a dancer's face clearly .
SENTENCE but  ?
SENTENCE um ,  i have never used a movie camera or edited film before .
SENTENCE how will we learn everything we need to know to  ?
SENTENCE oh ,  don't worry .
SENTENCE the cameras you will be using are pretty simple to operate .
SENTENCE and you'll get to play with the film editing software several times before beginning your project .
SENTENCE you'll also have the option of working with a student in the film department ,  someone who's familiar with the technology .
SENTENCE but the choreography and the end result will be your responsibility of course .
SENTENCE could you talk some more about the film   making techniques ,  you know ,  the ones that work best forscreen dances ?
SENTENCE i'll show some of my favorite screen dances next week to give you a better idea .
SENTENCE but ,  uh ,  ok .
SENTENCE here's one technique that can create the illusion of flow in a screen dance .
SENTENCE you film the same dancer ,  entering and exiting the frame several times .
SENTENCE moving slowly at first ,  then faster and faster .
SENTENCE then in the editing room ,  you can digitally manipulate these images ,  like you might put five or ten or twenty copies of that same dancer meeting himself in the middle of the screen ,  to make it look like he is dancing with himself .
SENTENCE obviously ,  this can't be done in a live performance .
SENTENCE another example ,  in one screen dance i saw ,  the dancers leap through sheets of fire in a big abandoned building .
SENTENCE of course ,  the building wasn't really on fire .
SENTENCE a technique called super imposing was used .
SENTENCE the dancers were filmed and layered in the editing room .
SENTENCE the fire was added to the background .
SENTENCE that sounds awesome .
SENTENCE but if anyone can watch a dance on a computer screen .
SENTENCE why would they pay to go see a live performance ?
SENTENCE what if screen dance got so popular that it replaced live dance ?
SENTENCE screen dance is an entirely different type of presentation .
SENTENCE it could never replicate the immediacy ,  the kind of drama that live performance offers .
SENTENCE there will be an audience for that .
SENTENCE i think what screen dance will do ,  though ,  is heighten awareness of dance in general .
SENTENCE because it is a way  ?
SENTENCE u h ,  it can reach people in their homes ,  in their workplaces ,  at anytime really .
SENTENCE and if someone discovers that they love dance by watching a screen dance ,  there's a good chance they will get interested enough to buy a ticket to see a live performance .
