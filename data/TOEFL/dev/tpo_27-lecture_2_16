SENTENCE so musical instruments evolved in ways that optimize their acoustical properties ,  how the instrument vibrates and sends those vibration through the air to our eardrums .
SENTENCE now professional musicians are very particular about their instruments ,  they want instruments that help them fully express the intent of the composer ,  which of course translates into a more enjoyable listening experience for the audience members .
SENTENCE yet most audience members probably aren't even aware of how much the instrument matters .
SENTENCE i mean ,  ok .
SENTENCE think about the last concert you attended .
SENTENCE when you applauded ,  what went through your mind ?
SENTENCE i recently heard a violinist who totally blew me away .
SENTENCE so when i applauded ,  i guess i was showing my appreciation for his skill ,  the hours of practicing he must have put in .
SENTENCE didn't really think about it .
SENTENCE it looked exactly like mine ,  which is inspiring in a way knowing my violin could also produce beautiful tones ,  that maybe i would sound that good someday .
SENTENCE i hope you do .
SENTENCE but if your violin isn't as good as his you mean he might not sound as good playing my violin ?
SENTENCE as i said ,  tone quality differs from instrument to instrument .
SENTENCE the question is why .
SENTENCE why does one instrument sound more beautiful than another ,  even if they look identical ?
SENTENCE there's a particularly interesting case with an extraordinary generation of violins made in northern italy ,  in the city of cremona ,  back in the late 16 's   early 17 's .
SENTENCE these vintage cremonese violins are considered the best in the world .
SENTENCE but it's not like the makers of those violins were any more skilled than their modern day counterparts .
SENTENCE they weren't .
SENTENCE today's top violin makers can pretty much replicate all the physical attributes of a cremonese violin .
SENTENCE but it's generally thought that the acoustical quality of modern violins doesn't live up to the quality of the vintage ones .
SENTENCE so what attributes of the old violins have been replicated ?
SENTENCE oh ,  their dimensions ,  shape ,  their fingerboard height ,  uh ,  general craftsmanship .
SENTENCE for a long time ,  people thought the varnish used to coat and protect the violins was special .
SENTENCE but research showed it was the same ordinary varnish used on furniture .
SENTENCE however ,  researchers have discovered that there are something special about the wood the violins were made from .
SENTENCE and recently they have been able to replicate that too .
SENTENCE how ?
SENTENCE unless the trees that cremonese used are still alive .
SENTENCE the trees weren't replicated ,  just the wood ,  specifically the wood's density .
SENTENCE density is determined by how trees grow .
SENTENCE trees ,  old trees that don't grow in the tropics grow seasonally ,  they grow faster early in the year in the springtime than they do later in the year .
SENTENCE so early growth wood is relatively porous .
SENTENCE late growth wood is denser ,  less porous .
SENTENCE and this variation shows up in the trees growth rings .
SENTENCE the denser layers are generally darker than the less dense layers .
SENTENCE we call this variation the density differential .
SENTENCE variations in wood density affect vibrations ,  and therefore ,  sound .
SENTENCE when scientists first analyzed the wood of vintage cremonese violins in compared with the modern violin wood ,  they calculated the average density and found no difference .
SENTENCE later ,  other researchers measured the density differential and found a significant difference .
SENTENCE modern violins had a greater variation ,  a larger differential .
SENTENCE so you mean the density of the wood in the cremonese violins is ,  is more uniform ?
SENTENCE but northern italy isn't in the tropics .
SENTENCE no .
SENTENCE but climate matters .
SENTENCE turns out the cremonese violins were made from trees that grew during a little ice age ,  a period when temperatures across europe were significantly lower than normal .
SENTENCE so the trees grew more evenly throughout the year ,  making the density differential relatively small .
SENTENCE but you said someone replicated the cremonese wood .
SENTENCE the density differential was replicated .
SENTENCE what did they do ?
SENTENCE try to simulate an ice age climate in their greenhouse and grow some trees in there ?
SENTENCE no ,  what happened was a material scientist figured out a way to process wood to make it acoustically similar to the cremonese wood .
SENTENCE he basically exposed the wood to a species of fungus ,  uh ,  a mushroom .
SENTENCE in the forest ,  fungi are decomposers .
SENTENCE they break down dead wood .
SENTENCE but this particular fungus nibbles away only at certain layers in the wood ,  leaving other layers alone .
SENTENCE as a result ,  the density differential of the fungi treated wood approach that of the cremonese wood .
QUESTION the professor describes an experiment in which wood was exposed to a fungus before being made into a violin what point does the professor make about the fungus
OPTION it decomposes only certain parts of the wood 1
OPTION it was found only in the forests of northern italy 0
OPTION it was recently discovered in a vintage cremonese violin 0
OPTION it decomposes only certain species of trees 0
