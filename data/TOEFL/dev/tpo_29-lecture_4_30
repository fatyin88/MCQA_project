SENTENCE today let's begin to look at structural engineering in the space age .
SENTENCE uh ,  new problems new possibilities mean we can think in new ways ,  find radically different approaches .
SENTENCE so let's consider uh ,  well ,  what would you say is the biggest obstacle today to putting structures ,  equipment ,  people  uh ,  anything really ,  into space ?
SENTENCE well ,  the cost ,  right ?
SENTENCE exactly .
SENTENCE i mean ,  just taking the space shuttle up and back one time is hugely expensive .
SENTENCE uh ,  why ?
SENTENCE i guess a lot of it is for fuel ,  right ?
SENTENCE to to get the rocket going fast enough .
SENTENCE good .
SENTENCE so we are burning up an enormous amount of fuel at every launch just to get the rocket up to what's known as escape velocity .
SENTENCE now ,  escape velocity is around 11 kilometers a second ,  pretty fast .
SENTENCE but do we really have to go this fast ?
SENTENCE well ,  yeah .
SENTENCE i mean ,  how else can you ,  um escape ?
SENTENCE i mean ,  that's the whole point of escape velocity ,  right ?
SENTENCE otherwise gravity will pull you back down to the earth .
SENTENCE actually ,  that's a common misconception .
SENTENCE escape velocity is simply the speed of an object that's  uh ,  let's say ,  shot out of a cannon the minimum initial speed so that the object could later escape earth's gravity on its own .
SENTENCE but that's just if there's no additional force being applied .
SENTENCE if you keep on supplying force to the object ,  keep on pushing it upward .
SENTENCE it could pull away from earth's gravity at any speed .
SENTENCE even really slow ?
SENTENCE so you're saying  like ,  if you had a ladder tall enough ,  you could just climb into space ?
SENTENCE yeah !
SENTENCE uh ,  well ,  theoretically .
SENTENCE i mean ,  i can see some practical problems with the ladder example .
SENTENCE uh ,  like you might get just a little bit tired out after the first few thousand kilometers or so ,  uh ,  especially with all the oxygen tanks you'll have to be hauling up with you .
SENTENCE no .
SENTENCE i was thinking more along the lines of an elevator .
SENTENCE wait !
SENTENCE you are serious ?
SENTENCE sure .
SENTENCE an elevator .
SENTENCE that's a new idea to most of us ,  but in fact it's been around for over a century .
SENTENCE if we could power such an elevator with solar energy ,  we could simply rise up into space for a fraction of the cost of a trip by rocket or shuttle .
SENTENCE but wait ,  elevators don't just rise up .
SENTENCE it have  sic   to hang on some kind of wire or track or something .
SENTENCE uh ,  true .
SENTENCE and for decades that's exactly what's prevented the idea from being feasible or even just taken seriously .
SENTENCE where do we find the material strong enough yet lightweight enough to act as a cable or track .
SENTENCE i mean ,  we are talking 36 ,     kilometers here .
SENTENCE and the strain on the cable would be more than most materials could bear .
SENTENCE but a new material developed recently has a tensile strength higher than diamond ,  yet it's much more flexible .
SENTENCE i am talking about carbon nanotubes .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE i've read something about carbon nanotubes .
SENTENCE they are strong ,  alright ,  but aren't they just very short little cylinders in shape ?
SENTENCE ah ,  yes .
SENTENCE but these cylinders cling together at a molecular level .
SENTENCE you pull out one nanotube or row of nanotubes ,  and its neighbor's come with it ,  and their neighbors ,  and so on .
SENTENCE so you could actually draw out a 36 ,     kilometer strand or ribbon of nanotubes stronger than steel ,  but maybe a thousandth the thickness of a human hair .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE fine .
SENTENCE but what's going to hold this ribbon up and keep it reach enough to support an elevator car ?
SENTENCE well ,  we definitely have to anchor it at both ends .
SENTENCE so what we need is a really tall tower here on the ground right at the equator and a satellite in geostationary orbit around the earth .
SENTENCE there's a reason i mentioned that figure of 36 ,     kilometers .
SENTENCE that's about how high an object would have to be orbiting straight up from the equator to constantly remain directly above the exact same spot on the rotating planet earth .
SENTENCE so once you are in this geostationary orbit right over the tower ,  just lower your carbon nanotube cable down from the satellite ,  tether it to the tower here on earth .
SENTENCE and there you have it !
SENTENCE so you really think this is a possibility ?
SENTENCE like ,  how soon could it happen ?
SENTENCE well ,  the science fiction writer arthur c .
SENTENCE clarke talked about building a space elevator back in the 197's .
SENTENCE and when someone asked him when he thought this idea might become a reality ,  his reply was ,   probably about fifty years after everybody quits laughing .

QUESTION what does the professor imply about using carbon nanotubes in the development of space elevators
OPTION current technology is good enough to make space elevators even without nanotubes 0
OPTION we do not yet have the technology to bind nanotubes together in a ribbon 0
OPTION nanotube cables would not be rigid enough to support an elevator car 0
OPTION nanotubes are the kinds of materials that will be needed if space elevators are ever to be built 1
