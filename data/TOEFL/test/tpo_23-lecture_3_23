SENTENCE we have been talking about how sea animals find their way underwater ,  how they navigate ,  and this brings up an interesting puzzle ,  and one i'm sure you'll all enjoy .
SENTENCE i mean ,  everybody loves dolphins ,  right ?
SENTENCE and dolphins ,  well ,  they actually produce two types of sounds .
SENTENCE uh ,  one being the vocalizations you are probably all familiar with ,  which they emit through their blowholes .
SENTENCE but the one we are concerned with today is the rapid clicks that they use for echolocation ,  so they can sense what is around them .
SENTENCE these sounds ,  it has been found ,  are produced in the air filled nasal sacs of the dolphin .
SENTENCE and the puzzle is how does the click sounds get transmitted into the water ?
SENTENCE it's not as easy as it might seem .
SENTENCE you see ,  the denser the medium ,  the faster sound travels .
SENTENCE so sound travels faster through water than it does through air .
SENTENCE so what happens when a sound wave um  ?
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE you've got a sound wave traveling merrily along through one medium ,  when suddenly  it hits a different medium ,  what does gonna happen then ?
SENTENCE well ,  some of the energy is going to be reflected back ,  and some of it is going to be transmitted into the second medium .
SENTENCE and  ?
SENTENCE and  ?
SENTENCE and if the two media have really different densities ,  like air and water ,  then most of the energy is going to be reflected back ,  very little of it will keep going ,  uh ,  get transmitted into the new medium .
SENTENCE i mean ,  just think how little noise from the outside world actually reaches you when your head is underwater .
SENTENCE so ,  how did the dolphin's clicks get transmitted from its air filled nasal sacs into the ocean water ?
SENTENCE because given the difference in density between the air in the nasal cavity and the seawater ,  we'd expect those sounds to just kind of go bouncing around inside the dolphin's head ,  which will do it no good at all .
SENTENCE if it's going to navigate it ,  needs those sounds to be broadcast and bounced back from objects in its path .
SENTENCE well ,  turns out dolphins have a structure in their foreheads ,  just in front of their nasal sacs ,  called a melon .
SENTENCE now ,  the melon is kind of a large sac like pouch ,  made up of fat tissue .
SENTENCE and this fat tissue has some rather fascinating acoustical properties .
SENTENCE most of the fat that you find in an animal's body is used for storing energy ,  but this fat ,  which you find in dolphins ,  and only in the melon and around the lower jaw .
SENTENCE this fat is very different ,  very rich in oil .
SENTENCE and it turns out it has a very different purpose as well .
SENTENCE now ,  one way to um ,  modify the overcome this mismatch in the density of air and water would be  ?
SENTENCE if you travels through velocity of the sound wave ,  make it precisely match the speed at which water .
SENTENCE and that's exactly what marine biologists have discovered the melon note that the bursa ,  these little projections at the rear of the melon ,  are right up against the air filled nasal sacs .
SENTENCE and these bursa ,  it turns out ,  are what's responsible for transferring sound to the melon .
SENTENCE the sound waves are then transmitted by the bursa through the melon .
SENTENCE first through a low velocity core ,  and then through a high velocity shell ,  where their speed is increased before they are transmitted into the surrounding seawater .
SENTENCE so now the signals can be efficiently transferred into the water ,  with minimal reflection .
SENTENCE the only other place ,  this special fatty tissue ,  like that in the melon ,  the only other place is found in the dolphin ,  is in the lower jaw .
SENTENCE turns out that the lower jaw ,  well ,  it is made of a specially thin bone .
SENTENCE and it is very sensitive to vibrations ,  to sound energy traveling through the seawater .
SENTENCE it turns out that the jaw is primarily responsible for capturing and transferring returning sound waves to the dolphin's inner ear .
SENTENCE so these rapid clicks that are sent out bounce off objects ,  maybe a group of fish swimming over here ,  a boat coming from over there .
SENTENCE the sounds bounce off them and the lower jaw captures the returning sounds ,  making it possible for the dolphin to sense what's in the surrounding water and decide where to swim .
