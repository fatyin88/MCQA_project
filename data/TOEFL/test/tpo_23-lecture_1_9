SENTENCE i was talking to one of my colleagues in the physics department the other day ,  and we ended up discussing how one discovery can change everything .
SENTENCE my colleague mentioned how the theory of relativity completely changed the field of physics .
SENTENCE at any rates ,  that conversation got me thinking about archaeological finds that really changed our understanding of ancient civilizations .
SENTENCE so i want to talk about the discovery of the antikythera mechanism .
SENTENCE the antikythera mechanism was found a hundred years ago ,  under water in an ancient greek shipwreck in the mediterranean sea .
SENTENCE it was in extremely poor condition and in many corroded pieces .
SENTENCE but once we figured out what it was and reconstructed it .
SENTENCE well ,  i simply don't have the words to convey how extraordinary this find was .
SENTENCE the antikythera mechanism is a relatively small device ,  roughly the size of a shoebox ,  made of gears fitted inside a wooden case .
SENTENCE in its original state ,  there were rotating dials and other indicators on the top ,  with letters and drawings showing the sun ,  the phases of the moon and different constellations .
SENTENCE inside the box ,  bronze gears would have rotated the displays .
SENTENCE the displays ,  uh ,  the indicators of the antikythera mechanism ,  would then moved to show the motion of the sun and moon relative to the planets and stars .
SENTENCE the device could be used to tell the different phases of the moon and much more .
SENTENCE well ,  scientists have recently analyzed the inscriptions on the mechanism and re examine the other cargo in the ship wreck ,  and the evidence makes an absolute case that this device dates back to ancient greece somewhere between 15  and 1   b .
SENTENCE c .
SENTENCE e .
SENTENCE what makes that so fascinating is that before we found the antikythera mechanism ,  the earliest device we had that could track the sun and moon like this was invented over 1 ,     years later .
SENTENCE so when this was first found ,  people literally would not believe it .
SENTENCE some of my colleagues insisted it had to have been made well after 1   b .
SENTENCE c .
SENTENCE e .
SENTENCE but this physical evidence was conclusive .
SENTENCE it was that old .
SENTENCE of course part of what made this find so unusual is that the antikythera mechanism is constructed of bronze .
SENTENCE now ,  it is not that bronze was all that rare in greece then ,  it is just that bronze was valuable and could easily be recycled .
SENTENCE it would have been relatively easy for a person with knowledge of metals to melt down bronze objects and forge them into  ?
SENTENCE well ,  say ,  coins .
SENTENCE bronze was used to made money back then .
SENTENCE or mold the bronze into anything else of value for that matter .
SENTENCE we are very fortunate that the device ended up under water ,  because otherwise it probably would have ended up recycled into  ?
SENTENCE who knows what .
SENTENCE now ,  it was a challenge to figure out the antikythera mechanism .
SENTENCE it spent over 2 ,     years at the bottom of the sea before it was discovered .
SENTENCE and even after it was discovered ,  it was still a number of years before we really understood what it was .
SENTENCE you see ,  the mechanism had corroded underwater ,  and many of the gears were stuck together in a mass .
SENTENCE cleaning it was only partly successful .
SENTENCE we could only get a good look at the structure of the gears after gamma rays were used to see inside ,  very similar to the way x rays are used to see your bones .
SENTENCE now ,  once we got a good look inside ,  we saw a really complex device .
SENTENCE the many gears not only moved in a way that could indicate the phases of the moon .
SENTENCE the antikythera mechanism also tracked both the lunar year and the solar year .
SENTENCE additionally ,  the gears also moved to match the motions of the planet and predicted eclipses .
SENTENCE but one thing that is particularly notable is that the mechanism was so precise that it even took into account a particular irregularity in the moon's orbit ,  which requires some very complex math to replicate in mechanical device .
SENTENCE you could say that the antikythera mechanism was a very precise calendar ,  which stands to reasons calendars were very important to ancient peoples .
SENTENCE religious festivals had to be held at the right time of year ,  crops needed to be planted at the right time as well .
SENTENCE and let's not forget that eclipses in planetary motions had important symbolic meanings .
QUESTION according to the professor , why is it unusual to discover a bronze artifact from ancient greece
OPTION bronze objects were often recycled 1
OPTION bronze corrodes underwater very quickly 0
OPTION ancient greeks had limited access to bronze 0
OPTION artists of ancient greece preferred to work with other materials 0
