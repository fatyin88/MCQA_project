SENTENCE as you know ,  researchers have long been interested in discovering exactly how intelligent animals are .
SENTENCE today we are going to talk about a particular cognitive ability some animals seem to have the ability to recognize themselves in a mirror .
SENTENCE oh .
SENTENCE i've heard about that .
SENTENCE chimpanzees have it .
SENTENCE right .
SENTENCE chimpanzees and other primates ,  chimps ,  gorillas ,  orangutans ,  and of course ,  humans .
SENTENCE but it's also been found in elephants and bottlenose dolphins ,  a bit of a surprise .
SENTENCE it's very rare .
SENTENCE most animals don't have it .
SENTENCE and it's called mirror self recognition ,  or msr .
SENTENCE well ,  how does it work ?
SENTENCE i mean ,  how do researchers know if elephants or chimps recognize themselves ?
SENTENCE researchers give them a mirror mark test .
SENTENCE in the mirror mark test ,  researchers put a mark on the animal where the animal is unable to see it or smell it or feel it ,  like on the side of their head ,  without looking in the mirror .
SENTENCE now ,  typically ,  when animals first see themselves in the mirror ,  they think they are seeing another animal .
SENTENCE often they will look for this animal behind the mirror .
SENTENCE they may even exhibit aggressive behavior .
SENTENCE but some animals ,  after this period of exploration ,  exhibit behaviors that show they know they are looking at themselves .
SENTENCE for instance ,  elephants will touch the mark on their heads with their trunks .
SENTENCE now ,  it's been assumed that primates and some other mammals stood alone at the top of the hierarchy of cognitive evolution .
SENTENCE but recently ,  birds have been found to possess some of the same cognitive abilities !
SENTENCE in particular ,  researchers have discovered these abilities in corvids ,  birds of the corvidae family .
SENTENCE corvids include ravens ,  jays ,  crows and magpies among others .
SENTENCE and what kinds of cognitive abilities are we talking about ?
SENTENCE well ,  corvids and some mammals have the ability to plan for the future ,  to store food for instance ,  in places where they can find it later .
SENTENCE it's been suggested in fact that jays ,  corvids known for stealing each other's food ,  may hide their food precisely because they are projecting their own tendency to steal onto other jays .
SENTENCE so let's talk about a study recently conducted with magpies .
SENTENCE as i said ,  magpies are corvids .
SENTENCE and because corvids have these other cognitive skills ,  researchers wanted to see if they were also capable of mirror self recognition .
SENTENCE so they gave them the mirror mark test ,  placing yellow sticker on the birds  black throat feathers .
SENTENCE at first ,  the magpies all engage in the same social behaviors that other animals do looking behind the mirror ,  etc .
SENTENCE but eventually ,  some of the birds ,  while looking in the mirror ,  kept scratching at the mark until they got rid of it .
SENTENCE and they didn't scratch at it when there was no mirror around .
SENTENCE so they passed the test .
SENTENCE wow !
SENTENCE do any other birds have this ability ?
SENTENCE well ,  not that we know of .
SENTENCE there was a study using pigeons ,  where researchers attempted to reduce msr to a matter of conditioning ,  that is ,  they claimed that the ability to recognize oneself in a mirror could be learned .
SENTENCE so these researchers basically trained some pigeons to pass the mirror mark test .
SENTENCE but two things are noteworthy here .
SENTENCE one ,  no one's ever replicated the study .
SENTENCE but more importantly ,  it misses the point .
SENTENCE the issue isn't whether some behavior can be learned .
SENTENCE it's whether a species has developed this ability spontaneously .
SENTENCE so what does the test tell us about corvids or chimpanzees ?
SENTENCE good question .
SENTENCE for one thing ,  it is important because it sets animals with a sense of self apart from those without a sense of self .
SENTENCE but more importantly ,  many researchers believe that msr is indicative of other advanced cognitive abilities .
SENTENCE self awareness ,  even in its earliest stages ,  might entail an awareness of others ,  the ability to see their perspective ,  to look at the world from another's point of view .
SENTENCE this is crucial ,  because it implies a high level of cognitive development .
SENTENCE it's perhaps the first stage toward the development of empathy .
SENTENCE but birds  brains are so small compared to primates .
SENTENCE true .
SENTENCE though corvids do have unusually large brains for birds .
SENTENCE but size isn't the whole story .
SENTENCE it's thought that primates are so intelligent because of a certain part of their brains ,  which birds simply don't have .
SENTENCE but there is an area in birds  brains that researchers believe governs similar cognitive functions .
SENTENCE so primates and birds  brains have evolved along different tracks ,  but ended up with similar abilities .
QUESTION when giving magpies the mirror mark test, why did researchers play the mark on the magpies throats
OPTION throat markings trigger aggressive behavior in other magpies 0
OPTION throat markings are extremely rare in magpies 0
OPTION magpies cannot see their own throats without looking in a mirror 1
OPTION magpies cannot easily remove a mark from their throats 0
