SENTENCE hi ,  jean how was the uh ,  the conference ,  right ?
SENTENCE the conference on volunteerism ?
SENTENCE that's where you were last week yeah .
SENTENCE it was great .
SENTENCE i met a lot of people from some really amazing organizations that are working in the area now it would be a lot easier to get students to volunteer in the community plus ,  i've never been to any of the beaches here before being at the beach was definitely a plus well ,  i hope you had time to look over the notes from the class you missed you did get the notes ,  right ?
SENTENCE yup i ii look them over before tomorrow's class good and let me know if you have any questions .
SENTENCE well ,  there is something that i wanted to ask you now it's about something i noticed at the beach well ,  see ,  there are a lot of jellyfish there ,  floating in the water .
SENTENCE that couldn't have been pleasant .
SENTENCE not for swimming .
SENTENCE but it was interesting .
SENTENCE i mean ,  the jelleyfish were glowing i swear they were and i am wondering what that's about ah ,  glowing jellyfish that is interesting .
SENTENCE uh ,  it's called bioluminescence and actually we are going to talk about it later in the semester basically ,  bioluminescence is light that's produced by a chemical reaction .
SENTENCE really ?
SENTENCE inside the jellyfish ?
SENTENCE well ,  not all jellyfish ,  about half of them actually ,  a lot of marine organisms have this ability ,  especially in deeper parts of the ocean oh ?
SENTENCE i get it .
SENTENCE like the darker it gets ,  the more the fish needs light ,  right ?
SENTENCE well bioluminescence serves a number of functions most aquatic organisms use it for communication and for attracting prey but jellyfish usually use it as a defense against predators some jellyfish produce bright flashes of light that confuse predators ,  to ,  uh ,  to startle them but jellyfish closer to the surface ,  probably like the jellyfish you saw ,  they use bioluminescence to hide the light they produce matches the color of the dim sunlight ,  so they blend in ,  and ,  uh ,  and predators can't see them wow ,  really ?
SENTENCE well ,  i am looking for a topic for my term paper  , so maybe i could do it on these glowing jellyfish that's why i wanted to ask you about them ,  you know ,  to find out if there was really something to write about it's a great topic but you ii have to make sure the topic is manageable like i said ,  about half of all jellyfish are bioluminescent ,  so you may want to look at a particular type of jellyfish or several types that benefit from bioluminescence in the same way ,  or you could investigate current research on bioluminescence ,  on ,  on the chemical process ,  or here's an idea you seem to be very involved in local issues see if youcan identify the jellyfish you observed on the beach and how they fit into the local ecosystem yeah ,  you know ,  some of the environmental groups i met last week might even be able to help me  .
QUESTION according to the professor, why were the jellyfish that the student saw glowing
OPTION they were avoiding predators by blending in with their surrounding 1
OPTION they were trying to confuse predators with bright flashes of light 0
OPTION they were communicating with each other 0
OPTION they were trying to light up the dark water so they could see prey 0
