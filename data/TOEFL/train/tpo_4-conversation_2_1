SENTENCE hey ,  jane ,  you look like you are in a hurry .
SENTENCE yeah ,  things are a little crazy .
SENTENCE oh yeah ?
SENTENCE what's going on ?
SENTENCE oh ,  it's nothing .
SENTENCE well ,  since it's your class ,  i guess it's ok .
SENTENCE it's ,  it's just that i am having trouble with my group project .
SENTENCE ah ,  yes ,  due next week .
SENTENCE what's your group doing again ?
SENTENCE it's about united states supreme court decisions .
SENTENCE we are looking at the impact of recent cases on property rights ,  municipal land use cases ,  owning disputes .
SENTENCE right ,  ok .
SENTENCE and it's not going well ?
SENTENCE not really .
SENTENCE i'm worried about the other two people in my group .
SENTENCE they are just sitting back ,  not really doing their fair share of the work and waiting for an a .
SENTENCE it's kind of stressing me out ,  because we are getting close to the deadline and i feel like i'm doing everything for this project .
SENTENCE ah ,  the good old free rider problem .
SENTENCE ah ,  it's just a term that describes this situation ,  when people in the group seek to get the benefits of being in a group without contributing to the work .
SENTENCE anyway ,  what exactly do you mean when you say they just sit back ?
SENTENCE i mean ,  they've been filing the weekly progress reports with me .
SENTENCE yes ,  but i feel like i'm doing 9   of the work .
SENTENCE i hate to sound so negative here ,  but honestly ,  they are taking credit for things they shouldn't take credit for .
SENTENCE like last week in the library ,  we decided to split up the research into 3 parts and then each of us was supposed to find sources in the library for our parts .
SENTENCE i went off to the stack and found some really good material for my part ,  but when i got back to our table ,  they were just goofing off and talking .
SENTENCE so i went and got materials for their sections as well .
SENTENCE um you know you shouldn't do that .
SENTENCE i know ,  but i didn't want to risk the project going down the drain .
SENTENCE i know teresa and kevin .
SENTENCE i had both of them in other courses .
SENTENCE so ,  i'm familiar with the work and work habits .
SENTENCE i know ,  me too .
SENTENCE and that's why this has really surprised me .
SENTENCE do you does your group like your topic ?
SENTENCE well ,  i think we'd all rather focus on cases that deal with personal liberties ,  questions about freedom of speech ,  things like that .
SENTENCE but i chose property rights .
SENTENCE yeah ,  i thought it would be good for us ,  all of us to try something new .
SENTENCE um maybe that's part of the problem .
SENTENCE maybe teresa and kevin aren't that excited about the topic ?
SENTENCE and since you picked it ,  have you thought talk to them at all about picking a different topic ?
SENTENCE but we've got all the sources and it's due next week .
SENTENCE we don't have time to start from scratch .
SENTENCE ok ,  i will let you go  cause i know you are so busy .
SENTENCE but you might consider talking to your group about your topic choice .
SENTENCE i will think about it .
SENTENCE got to run ,  see you in class .
