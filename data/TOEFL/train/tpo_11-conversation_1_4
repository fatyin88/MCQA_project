SENTENCE hi ,  i need to pick up a gym pass .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE i'll need your name ,  year ,  and university id .
SENTENCE here's my id card .
SENTENCE and my name is gina kent ,  and i'm first year .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE gina .
SENTENCE i'll type up a pass for you right away .
SENTENCE great !
SENTENCE this is exciting .
SENTENCE i can't wait to get started .
SENTENCE oh ,  this is a wonderful gym .
SENTENCE that's what everybody has been saying .
SENTENCE everyone is talking about the newpool and the new indoor courts .
SENTENCE but what i love is all the classes .
SENTENCE yes ,  like the swimming and tennis classes and everything .
SENTENCE oh yeah ,  but this pass doesn't entitle you to those .
SENTENCE no ,  the classes fall into a separate category .
SENTENCE but ,  that's my whole reason for getting a pass .
SENTENCE i mean ,  i was planning to take abut that's not how it works .
SENTENCE this pass gives you access to the gym and to all the equipment ,  and to the pool and so forth .
SENTENCE but not when the teams are practicing ,  so you'll have to check the schedule .
SENTENCE but what do i have to do if i want to take a class ?
SENTENCE you have to  one ,  register  and two ,  pay the fee for the class .
SENTENCE well ,  i think if you think about it .
SENTENCE you'll see that it's fair .
SENTENCE but people who play sports in the gym  they don't have to pay anything .
SENTENCE yes ,  but they just come in ,  and play or swim on their own .
SENTENCE but ,  taking a class   that is a different story ,  i mean ,  someone has to pay the instructors .
SENTENCE so ,  if i want to enroll in a class .then you have to pay extra .
SENTENCE the fee isn't very high ,  but there's a fee .
SENTENCE so ,  what class did you say you want to take ?
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE swimming classes are thirty dollars a semester .
SENTENCE i guess i could swing that .
SENTENCE but i'm still not convinced it's fair .
SENTENCE so ,  do i pay you ?
SENTENCE well ,  first ,  you need to talk to the instructor .
SENTENCE they have to assess your level and steer you to the right class ,  you know ,  beginner ,  intermediate you mean ,  i have to swim for them ?
SENTENCE show them what i can do ?
SENTENCE no ,  no ,  you just tell them a little bit about your experience and skill ,  so theyknow what level you should be in .
SENTENCE oh ,  ok .
SENTENCE so ,  i guess i'll need an appointment .
SENTENCE and i can make that for you right now .
SENTENCE and then i'll type up your gym id card .
SENTENCE you'll need it to get into the building .
SENTENCE now about that appointment  how does wednesday at three sound ?
