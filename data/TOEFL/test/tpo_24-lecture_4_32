SENTENCE many people have been fascinated about venus for centuries because of its thick cloud cover ,  this so called planet of mystery and all of that .
SENTENCE well ,  what's under those clouds ?
SENTENCE what's the surface of the planet like ?
SENTENCE some questions about the surface are still unresolved but ,  but we have learned a lot about it in the past several years .
SENTENCE first of all ,  let me talk about how we have been able to get past those clouds .
SENTENCE first ,  there were soviet modules2 that landed directly on the surface and sent back some images of what was around them .
SENTENCE second ,  we did some radar imaging from satellites from above .
SENTENCE radar can get through the clouds .
SENTENCE so what have we learned ?
SENTENCE yes ,  karen ?
SENTENCE well ,  i remember reading that there's not really a lot going on ,  that the surface of venus is just flat and smooth in a lot of places .
SENTENCE yeah ,  smooth in a lot of places .
SENTENCE but that's not ,  um   that's not the whole picture .
SENTENCE in other areas ,  you've got canyons ,  ripped valleys ,  meteo craters ,  uh ,  lava domes ,  these lava formations that look like giant pancakes .
SENTENCE and also volcanoes .
SENTENCE well ,  one of the most interesting features on the surface are in fact the shield volcanoes .
SENTENCE shield volcanoes formed when magma comes out of the ground in the same spot over and over again .
SENTENCE remember ,  magma is hot molten rock that's underground ,  and it is called lava when it reaches the surface .
SENTENCE uh ,  so the lava builds up ,  and hardens ,  and a volcano forms .
SENTENCE now ,  the lava on venus is thin .
SENTENCE it spreads out easily .
SENTENCE so shield volcanoes have very gentle sloping sides .
SENTENCE they are called shield volcanoes ,  because viewed from above ,  they kind of resemble shields ,  you know ,  like a warrior's shield .
SENTENCE but what's particularly interesting about these volcanoes is that most of the volcanoes here on earth are not shield volcanoes .
SENTENCE instead ,  they are other volcano types ,  like strata volcanoes ,  for example ,  which are a result of tectonic plate movement .
SENTENCE remember tectonic plates ?
SENTENCE underneath the earth's crust ,  there are a number of shifting slabs or plates that are slowly moving .
SENTENCE and in the zones on the edges of the plates where different plates meet and interact ,  that's where we get most of earth's volcanoeson venus ,  however ,  volcanoes are not clustered in discrete zones like they are on earth .
SENTENCE instead ,  they are more or less randomly scattered over venus's surface .
SENTENCE well ,  that's significant .
SENTENCE venus has mostly shield volcanoes ,  and they are randomly scattered ,  that indicates that venus does not have moving tectonic plates ,  and that's a big difference compared to earth .
SENTENCE here on earth ,  moving tectonic plates are a major geological element ,  just crucial for the whole surface dynamic ,  right ?
SENTENCE so why doesn't venus have them ?
SENTENCE well ,  there are a few theories .
SENTENCE one of them is that this has to do with the fact that venus has no surface water that's needed to kind of lubricate the movement of the plates ,  you know ,  like oceans on earth .
SENTENCE yeah ,  i forgot to spell that out .
SENTENCE uh ,  venus has no surface water .
SENTENCE wait a second .
SENTENCE did you say we have shield volcanoes on earth ?
SENTENCE can you give an example ?
SENTENCE sure .
SENTENCE the volcanoes in the hawaii islands ,  in the pacific ocean are shield volcanoes .
SENTENCE they are formed over a hot spot of magma .
SENTENCE so while on earth we have several types of volcanoes ,  on venus there's mostly the one type .
SENTENCE uh ,  eric ?
SENTENCE are the volcanoes on venus still active ?
SENTENCE well ,  that's an interesting question .
SENTENCE there is still some discussion on that point .
SENTENCE but here's what we do now .
SENTENCE first ,  the level of sulfur dioxide gas above venus's clouds shows large and very frequent fluctuations .
SENTENCE it is quite possible that these fluctuations ,  the huge increase and decrease of sulfur dioxide ,  happening again and again .
SENTENCE it's quite possible that this is due to volcanic eruptions ,  because volcanic eruptions often emit gases .
SENTENCE if that's the case ,  volcanism could very well be the root cause of venus's thick cloud cover .
SENTENCE and also we have observed bursts of radio energy from the planet's surface .
SENTENCE these bursts are similar to what we see when volcanoes erupt on earth .
SENTENCE so this too suggests ongoing volcanic activity .
SENTENCE but although this is intriguing evidence ,  no one's actually observed a venus volcano erupting yet ,  so we can't be positive .
QUESTION why does the professor mention the fact that venus has no surface water
OPTION to give an example of a discovery that was unexpected 0
OPTION to illustrate the consequences of intense volcanic activity 0
OPTION to question a theory about the origin of shield volcanoes 0
OPTION to suggest an explanation for why venus does not have moving tectonic plates 1
