SENTENCE excuse me ,  i'm supposed to be having my physics class in the science building ,  but no one's in the classroom .
SENTENCE could you tell me where the class is ?
SENTENCE physics 4 3   has it been moved ?
SENTENCE well ,  there's a room assignment sheet on the bulletin board outside this office .
SENTENCE yeah ,  i know ,  but my class isn't listed there .
SENTENCE there must be some kind of mistake or something .
SENTENCE could you look it up ,  please ?
SENTENCE hmmm   ok ,  let me check on the computer .
SENTENCE it's physics ,  right ?
SENTENCE wait ,  did you say physics 4 3 ?
SENTENCE er i'm sorry ,  but it says here that it was cancelled .
SENTENCE you should have gotten a letter from the registrar's office about this .
SENTENCE what ?
SENTENCE i've never got it .
SENTENCE are you sure ?
SENTENCE cause it says on the computer that the letter was sent out to students a week ago .
SENTENCE really ?
SENTENCE i should have gotten it by now .
SENTENCE i wonder if i threw it away with all the junk mail by mistake .
SENTENCE well ,  it does happen .
SENTENCE er  let me check something .
SENTENCE what's your name ?
SENTENCE ok ,  hmmm woodhouse ,  let me see  ah ,  it says here we sent it to your apartment on er  center street .
SENTENCE oh ,  that's my old apartment .
SENTENCE i moved out of there a little while ago .
SENTENCE well ,  and i suppose you haven't changed your mailing address at the administration office .
SENTENCE well ,  that would explain it .
SENTENCE yeah ,  i guess that's it .
SENTENCE but how can they cancel the class after offering it .
SENTENCE if i'd known this was going to happen ,  i would have taken it last semester .
SENTENCE i know ,  it's really inconvenient for you ,  i understand that ,  but er  if we don't have enough students signed up for the course ,  the college can't offer it .
SENTENCE you know ,  it's a practical issue ,  like we can't have an instructor when there're only a few students in the class .
SENTENCE you see what i mean ?
SENTENCE i guess ,  but now i don't know what course i should take instead .
SENTENCE ok ,  let's see .
SENTENCE do you have any courses you're going to take next semester ?
SENTENCE if you do ,  you might want to take them now and sign up for physics 4 3 next semester .
SENTENCE yeah ,  i guess i could do that .
SENTENCE i just hope it won't be cancelled again .
SENTENCE do you know how many people have to be enrolled in order to keep a class from being cancelled ?
SENTENCE well ,  it depends on the class ,  but for that class ,  you have to have er  let's see ,  usually it'd be at least ten people ,  but since it was cancelled this semester ,  they might even do it with less .
SENTENCE but do you know what you should do ?
SENTENCE give the physics department a call a couple of weeks before the semester starts .
SENTENCE they'll be able to tell you if they're planning to go through with it .
SENTENCE it's their decision ,  actually .
SENTENCE oh ,  ok ,  i will do that .
SENTENCE thanks for the info .
SENTENCE no problem .
SENTENCE sorry about the class .
SENTENCE oh ,  why don't you go change your mailing address now .
SENTENCE it'll only takes a minute .
SENTENCE oh ,  oh ,  sure ,  i will do that right way .
