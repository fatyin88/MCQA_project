SENTENCE i am so sorry i am late .
SENTENCE professor mills .
SENTENCE i just finished at the student medical center .
SENTENCE i twisted my ankle playing soccer this morning .
SENTENCE it took longer than i expected to see the doctor .
SENTENCE that's okay .
SENTENCE don't worry about it .
SENTENCE david .
SENTENCE so let's get started .
SENTENCE your paper on john dewey's political philosophy has a few issues i'd like to cover .
SENTENCE you gave a great biographical sketch in the beginning .
SENTENCE okay .
SENTENCE but then as you get into his political philosophy ,  i don't think you've done enough to situate his philosophy within the time period .
SENTENCE in other words ,  you haven't connected dewey's philosophy to the thinking of other intellectuals of the time .
SENTENCE so i haven't captured the most critical influences ,  the influences that were most significant to his political thinking ?
SENTENCE exactly .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE now ,  look back up at the section here ,  where you wrote about dewey's view of individuality .
SENTENCE this is all good content .
SENTENCE but you haven't presented the information in a systematic way .
SENTENCE i really think this portion on individuality needs to come later ,  after your paragraphs on dewey's intellectual influences .
SENTENCE after my revised paragraphs on what influenced them .
SENTENCE yes .
SENTENCE revised .
SENTENCE let me ask .
SENTENCE uh .
SENTENCE when you were finished writing ,  did you go back and ask yourself if all of the material was relevant ?
SENTENCE i do think there are areas that can be cut .
SENTENCE i guess what i am saying is that your paragraphs aren't really presented in a logical order .
SENTENCE the direction of your argument isn't crystal clear .
SENTENCE and there's some unnecessary material getting in the way .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE sounds like i have a lot to do .
SENTENCE and one more thing ,  do you have a copy of the department's document on the correct format for index ,  citations and references ?
SENTENCE no .
SENTENCE i mean ,  i look at it online when i was working on this assignment .
SENTENCE you really should print it out .
SENTENCE you are going to need it for every paper you write in the political science department .
SENTENCE it looks like you are getting it mix up with another referencing system .
SENTENCE oh .
SENTENCE yeah .
SENTENCE i used something different in high school .
SENTENCE it's so confusing switching to a new system .
SENTENCE i know .
SENTENCE but remember ,  everything needs to be consistent when it comes to referencing .
SENTENCE it is a very important academic convention .
SENTENCE oh ,  also ,  i wanted to ask you  will you be at the political science club meeting saturday ?
SENTENCE definitely .
SENTENCE the topic is john dewey .
SENTENCE yes .
SENTENCE are you interested in leading part of the discussion ?
SENTENCE tom hayward is looking for someone to help out .
SENTENCE i think you'll have a lot to contribute .
SENTENCE that'll be fun .
SENTENCE i will give him a call .
