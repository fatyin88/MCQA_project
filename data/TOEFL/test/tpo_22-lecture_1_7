SENTENCE one of the big questions when we look at prehistory is why did the earliest states form ?
SENTENCE well ,  to begin we'd better define exactly what we mean when we talk about states .
SENTENCE the human groups that are the smallest and have the least social and political complexity ,  we call bands .
SENTENCE the groups that are the largest and most socially and politically complex ,  we call states .
SENTENCE so ,  the level of complexity here refers to the organization of people into large ,  diverse groups ,  and densely populated communities .
SENTENCE and there are four levels in total  bands ,  tribes ,  chiefdoms and states .
SENTENCE but ,  but back to my original question .
SENTENCE why did early states form ?
SENTENCE why not just continue to live in small groups ?
SENTENCE why become more complex ?
SENTENCE one theory called the environmental approach hypothesizes that the main force behind state formation was population growth .
SENTENCE it assumes that centralized management was critical to dealing with issues caused by sudden population surges ,  like a strain on limited food supplies .
SENTENCE at the least complex end of the spectrum ,  the few families living in bands are able to meet their own basic needs .
SENTENCE they usually hunt together and forage whatever foods are available to them ,  instead of domesticating animals and planting crops .
SENTENCE in order to efficiently take advantage of the wild foods available ,  bands are often nomadic and move around following herds of animals .
SENTENCE this strategy is feasible when you have a small population .
SENTENCE but when you have a large population ,  well ,  the whole population can't just get up and move to follow a wild herd of animals .
SENTENCE so you need sophisticated technologies to produce enough food for everyone .
SENTENCE and there is an increase need to resolve social problems that arise as people begin to compete for resources .
SENTENCE to manage intensified food production ,  to collect ,  store and distribute food ,  you need centralized decision making ,  centralized decision makers .
SENTENCE it's the same thing when it comes to maintaining social order .
SENTENCE you need to create and efficiently enforce a formal legal code .
SENTENCE it makes sense to have a centralized authority in charge of that ,  right ?
SENTENCE so a hierarchy forms .
SENTENCE by definition ,  states had at least three social levels .
SENTENCE usually ,  an upper class of rulers ,  a middleclass comprised of managers and merchants ,  and a lower class of crop producers and agricultural laborers .
SENTENCE the environmental approach hypothesizes that states appear in certain environmental settings ,  settings which have a severe population problem or a shortage of agricultural land .
SENTENCE but not everyone agrees with the theory .
SENTENCE it definitely has some weaknesses .
SENTENCE for example ,  states have developed in places like the mild lowlands of mesoamerica and in egypt's nile river valley .
SENTENCE both places had vast areas of fertile farmland ,  no shortage of agricultural land .
SENTENCE and what about population increase ?
SENTENCE well ,  there were some early states that formed where there wasn't any sudden population increase .
SENTENCE so it seems that these are valid criticisms of the environmental approach .
QUESTION according to the professor , what are two typical characteristics of a band
OPTION it is the smallest type of group 1
OPTION it is the most sociopolitically complex type of group 0
OPTION it practices intensified agriculture 0
OPTION it is able to meet its own basic needs 1
