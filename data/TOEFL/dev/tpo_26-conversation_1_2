SENTENCE hi .
SENTENCE i saw your ad in the campus news paper .
SENTENCE oh .
SENTENCE we don't have any job opening right now .
SENTENCE oh ,  no .
SENTENCE i meant the other ad ,  about the services you provide for students .
SENTENCE you see ,  i have been working at the campus tutoring center as a math tutor .
SENTENCE but things have changed ,  including my schedule .
SENTENCE and now i want to start doing tutoring work independently .
SENTENCE but in order to ,  basically ,  start my own business ,  i need to get the work out .
SENTENCE i was thinking i should get something printed up that i can hand out to people .
SENTENCE ah .
SENTENCE well ,  actually ,  i just printed up some great looking flyers for someone doing the same thing .
SENTENCE flyers .
SENTENCE yeah ,  that's an idea .
SENTENCE i guess then i could post them around the campus .
SENTENCE yeah .
SENTENCE and you can hand them out too .
SENTENCE but ,  oh ,  you know what ?
SENTENCE i did something really neat for someone last week .
SENTENCE she didn't want to go the traditional route ,  you know ,  business cards ,  flyers ,  so we customized pencils for her .
SENTENCE yeah .
SENTENCE you know ,  a little message printed on the pencil .
SENTENCE yeah .
SENTENCE but you should know ,  it's not our cheapest option .
SENTENCE oh ,  and you know those little sticky notes ?
SENTENCE well ,  we did once .
SENTENCE i think those bright pieces of paper would be real attention getters .
SENTENCE you know ,  student use them all the time ,  so they should be good for business .
SENTENCE i don't know why we haven't done more .
SENTENCE so you've got some options .
SENTENCE right .
SENTENCE well ,  what about business cards ?
SENTENCE my friend has these business cards .
SENTENCE she does tutoring too .
SENTENCE and she got them at this place in town ,  but they were kind of expensive .
SENTENCE for business card ?
SENTENCE well ,  i don't know what your friend paid .
SENTENCE but we could do something real simple and it wouldn't be much .
SENTENCE like for a batch of 25  for one of our standard designs ,  2  dollars maybe .
SENTENCE now ,  there are some other choices that'll affect the cost .
SENTENCE you know ,  like different background patters ,  using color ink ,  that sort of thing .
SENTENCE and it also depends on how many words you want to include .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE well ,  i know what i want them to say .
SENTENCE but i am just thinking ,  i kind of like that pencil idea .
SENTENCE yeah .
SENTENCE i thought it was neat .
SENTENCE now ,  of course you can only fit your name and phone number ,  and like ,  in your case ,  math tutoring on it .
SENTENCE right .
SENTENCE well ,  i could custom design the business cards through ,  right ?
SENTENCE that's what my friend did .
SENTENCE she said she designed them at the computer right there at the print shop .
SENTENCE well ,  you can do that here too .
SENTENCE but a custom design would be a bigger investment for your business than one of our standard designs .
SENTENCE well ,  i don't know .
SENTENCE i am interested in business cards ,  so can i look at the standard designs ?
QUESTION what does the man imply about customized sticky notes
OPTION they require more time to produce than other print products 0
OPTION they are less effective at attracting business than business cards 0
OPTION they are not usually available at other print shops 0
OPTION they should be a more popular choice of advertising than they are 1
