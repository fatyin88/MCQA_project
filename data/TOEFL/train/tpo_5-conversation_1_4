SENTENCE hi ,  thanks for seeing me on such short notice .
SENTENCE no problem .
SENTENCE how can i help ?
SENTENCE well ,  i think i might have made a mistake coming to the school .
SENTENCE what makes you say that ?
SENTENCE i'm a little overwhelmed by the size of this place .
SENTENCE i come from a small town .
SENTENCE there were only 75 of us in my high school graduating class .
SENTENCE everyone knew everyone .
SENTENCE we all grew up together .
SENTENCE so it's a bit of a culture shock for you ?
SENTENCE being one of 15 ,     students on a big campus in an unfamiliar city ?
SENTENCE that's an understatement .
SENTENCE i just can't get comfortable in class or in the dorms .
SENTENCE you know ,  socially .
SENTENCE hmmm well ,  let's start with your academics .
SENTENCE tell me about your classes .
SENTENCE i'm taking mostly introductory courses and some are taught in these huge lecture halls .
SENTENCE and you are having trouble in keeping pace with the material ?
SENTENCE no ,  in fact i got an a on my first economics paper .
SENTENCE it's just that ,  it's so impersonal ,  i'm not used to it .
SENTENCE are all your classes impersonal ?
SENTENCE no ,  it's just that for example ,  in sociology yesterday ,  the professor asked a question ,  so i raised my hand ,  several of us raised our hands .
SENTENCE and i kept my hand up because i did the reading and knew the answer .
SENTENCE but the professor just answered his own question and continued with the lecture .
SENTENCE well ,  in a big room it's possible he didn't notice you .
SENTENCE maybe he was trying to save time .
SENTENCE in either case i wouldn't take it personally .
SENTENCE i suppose .
SENTENCE but i just don't know how to ,  you know ,  distinguish myself .
SENTENCE why not stop by his office during office hours ?
SENTENCE that wouldn't seem right .
SENTENCE you know ,  taking time from other students who need help ?
SENTENCE don't say that .
SENTENCE that's what office hours are for .
SENTENCE there is no reason you couldn't pop in to say hi and to make yourself known .
SENTENCE if you are learning a lot in class ,  let the professor know .
SENTENCE wouldn't you appreciate positive feedback if you were a professor ?
SENTENCE you are right .
SENTENCE that's a good idea .
SENTENCE ok ,  er let's turn to your social life .
SENTENCE how's it going in the dorms ?
SENTENCE i don't have much in common with my roommate or anyone else i've met so far .
SENTENCE everyone's into sports and i'm more artsy ,  you know ,  into music .
SENTENCE i play the cello .
SENTENCE hah ,  have you been playing long ?
SENTENCE since age ten .
SENTENCE it's a big part of my life .
SENTENCE at home i was the youngest member of our community orchestra .
SENTENCE you are not going to believe this .
SENTENCE there is a string quartet on campus ,  all students .
SENTENCE and it so happened that the cellist graduated last year .
SENTENCE they've been searching high and low for a replacement ,  someone with experience .
SENTENCE would you be interested in auditioning ?
SENTENCE absolutely .
SENTENCE i wanted to get my academic work settled before pursuing my music here .
SENTENCE but i think this would be a good thing for me .
SENTENCE i guess if i really want to fit in here i should find people who love music as much as i do .
SENTENCE thank you .
