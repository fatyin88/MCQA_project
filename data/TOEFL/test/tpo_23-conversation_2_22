SENTENCE hi ,  bob .
SENTENCE how is it going ?
SENTENCE are you enjoying the introduction to literature class ?
SENTENCE yeah ,  it's great .
SENTENCE araby ,  that short story by james joyce we read last week ,  it was awesome .
SENTENCE i'm glad you like it .
SENTENCE most of joyce's work is very complex .
SENTENCE a lot of students say that he is hard to understand .
SENTENCE normally ,  you wouldn't tackle joyce in an intro class ,  but i'd like to give my first year students a taste of his style ,  his psychological approach to literature ,  because  ?
SENTENCE mainly because it influenced other writers .
SENTENCE i only wish we had more class time to discuss it .
SENTENCE me too .
SENTENCE so why did you pick araby instead of some other story ?
SENTENCE well ,  um ,  first you should know that araby is one of fifteen short stories by joyce in a book called dubliners .
SENTENCE uh ,  all the stories are related to one another ,  and they are set in the same time period .
SENTENCE but araby is the easiest one to follow .
SENTENCE though all the stories in the collection are written in stream of consciousness ,  which as you know ,  means they are told through the 's thought ,  through an inner monologue ,  as opposed to dialogue or an objective description of events .
SENTENCE but araby is easier because it's linear ,  the story unfold chronologically .
SENTENCE still ,  i wish we could read whole novels by joyce and discussed them in class .
SENTENCE that's what happens in my master writer class .
SENTENCE yeah ,  i teach one on joyce every spring .
SENTENCE it's such a privilege ,  spending an entire term diving into a single body of work .
SENTENCE and my students ,  they bring so much insight to the table that it's easy to forget who the professor is .
SENTENCE oh ,  wow .
SENTENCE that could actually solve my dilemma ,  uh ,  what i originally wanted to ask you  ?
SENTENCE um ,  i am working on my schedule for next term ,  and i've got room for one more course ,  and i'd like to take more literature .
SENTENCE could i take your master writer class on joyce ?
SENTENCE i'm sorry .
SENTENCE i should have mentioned .
SENTENCE uh ,  master writer is an advanced seminar .
SENTENCE so students need to get a strong foundation in literary theory and criticism before i let them in the room .
SENTENCE but i have gotten really good grades on all my paper so far ,  i'm sure i can keep up .
SENTENCE couldn't you make an exception ?
SENTENCE your grades are excellent .
SENTENCE but in our intro class ,  you are reviewing the basics ,  like plots ,  setting and character and getting your first real exposure to different literary styles .
SENTENCE but why do i have to study different styles to understand joyce's novels ?
SENTENCE there are a lot of little details involved in interpreting literature .
SENTENCE and like with joyce .
SENTENCE his novels have very unique structures .
SENTENCE the only way to appreciate how you meet there is by studying a variety of authors .
SENTENCE oh ,  ok .
SENTENCE so could you suggest a different literature class then ?
SENTENCE sure .
SENTENCE there's doctor clain's course on nineteenth century novels .
SENTENCE it's more focused than the class you're in now .
SENTENCE but it will build on your current knowledge base and give you the background you need .
SENTENCE that ,  plus a couple more foundational classes ,  and you will definitely be ready for my seminar .
