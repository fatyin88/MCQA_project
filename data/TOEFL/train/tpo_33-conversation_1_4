SENTENCE hi .
SENTENCE i am a little lost .
SENTENCE um ,  is this the housing maintenance office ?
SENTENCE you found it .
SENTENCE how can i help you ?
SENTENCE oh ,  good .
SENTENCE i have a quick question .
SENTENCE are we allowed to keep electric heaters in our rooms ?
SENTENCE actually ,  you are not .
SENTENCE what's going on ?
SENTENCE your room cold ?
SENTENCE it's freezing in my room .
SENTENCE i think the heat went out or something .
SENTENCE are you sure it's out ?
SENTENCE maybe it just got turned out too far .
SENTENCE oh ,  no .
SENTENCE i tried adjusting the ,  uh ,  the heat control ,  but it doesn't make any difference .
SENTENCE it's so cold in my bedroom i can't sleep at night .
SENTENCE i've actually been sleeping on the sofa in the front room .
SENTENCE the heat still works in there .
SENTENCE actually ,  we get hot air in all the bedrooms except ours .
SENTENCE wow !
SENTENCE do you have a roommate ?
SENTENCE yeah .
SENTENCE but she said she isn't bothered by the cold .
SENTENCE but on the sofa ,  i am kept up by the noise out in the hall .
SENTENCE the dorms can sometimes get pretty noisy .
SENTENCE so what can be done about it ?
SENTENCE well ,  ok .
SENTENCE there's a couple of things we can do .
SENTENCE i can have a custodian take a look at it and see if he can do something .
SENTENCE actually ,  i asked the custodian yesterday to take a look .
SENTENCE but he said he couldn't find anything wrong .
SENTENCE he said that some of the other rooms have lost heat also and that if we'd come here you guys would fix it .
SENTENCE oh ,  he did ?
SENTENCE that's weird ,  because i would have well ,  the custodians themselves are usually supposed to report any problems right away .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE in that case ,  then what you need to do is here ,  fill out this form .
SENTENCE i have to fill out a form ?
SENTENCE yeah ,  but at least that'll put your heater problem in a work order for the maintenance crew and they'll get to you as soon as possible .
SENTENCE just so you know ,  because it's not winter yet and it's not as cold as it could be ,  it may take a few days for a maintenance crew to get to you .
SENTENCE a few days ?
SENTENCE i can't even sleep in my own room !
SENTENCE can't we just get an electric heater ?
SENTENCE i am sorry .
SENTENCE but students just aren't allowed .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE i can see that this is a problem ,  and not just with your room .
SENTENCE so if you can get the form back to me this afternoon ,  i'll try to get a maintenance crew to look at your problem by tomorrow .
SENTENCE how's that ?
SENTENCE oh ,  that would be great .
SENTENCE seriously .
SENTENCE i have to take off now .
SENTENCE but when i fill this form out ,  i give it to you ,  right ?
SENTENCE right .
SENTENCE and if i am not here ,  just put it in my box and i'll get it .
