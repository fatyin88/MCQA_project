SENTENCE last class someone asked about green marketing .
SENTENCE green marketing refers to companies promoting the products as environmentally friendly .
SENTENCE companies often turn to advertising experts to help them do this .
SENTENCE green marketing seems recent ,  but advertising professionals grew interest in it several decades ago .
SENTENCE the seeds for green marketing were probably planted in 197  ,  when the first earth day took place .
SENTENCE rallies all over the united states were organized to protest environmental degradation .
SENTENCE some 2  million demonstrators participated in that first earth day .
SENTENCE and it helped spark dozens of environmental laws .
SENTENCE the biggest was the endangered species act of 1973 ,  which protects imperiled animal species from extinction .
SENTENCE there was also passage of the clean water act and the clean air act was strengthened .
SENTENCE earth day ,  environmental laws ,  environmental issues in the news ,  being green was entering the mainstream .
SENTENCE and business started saying ,  hey ,  we can get involved in this .
SENTENCE so in 1975 ,  a major advertising trade group held its first workshop on ecological marketing .
SENTENCE a few years later ,  we began seeing ads tapping into people's environmental concerns .
SENTENCE but some green marketers learned the hard way ,  green marketing must still involve all the same principles of a traditional marketing campaign .
SENTENCE you ad must attract attention ,  stimulate consumers  interest ,  create a desire for your product ,  and motivate people to take action to buy your product .
SENTENCE so let me tell you about one green marketing campaign that failed at first and explain why .
SENTENCE it was a compact fluorescent light bulb .
SENTENCE we'll call it the eco light .
SENTENCE it was first introduced ,  i believe ,  in the late 9's .
SENTENCE it cost far more than a regular incandescent bulb .
SENTENCE the advertising message was ,  basically ,   use this eco light and save the planet  .
SENTENCE but that message wasn't effective .
SENTENCE research shows that consumers don't want to let go off any traditional product attributes ,  like convenience ,  price and quality .
SENTENCE even though surveys indicate that almost everybody cares about the environment .
SENTENCE so the company reintroduced the eco light with a new message ,  one that emphasized cost savings ,  that the eco light lowers electric bills and lasts for years .
SENTENCE so it's good for earth ,  cost effective and convenient because it doesn't have to be changed every few months .
SENTENCE this ad campaign worked like a charm .
SENTENCE something else ,  uh ,  the company that makes the co light ,  researchers would consider it an  extreme green company  ,  not only because its product are energy efficient ,  but because the company tries to reduce its environmental impact in other ways too like in addition to selling earth  friendly products ,  its offices and factories are designed to conserve energy and use all sorts of recycled materials a company that only recycles office paper ,  researchers would classify as a   lean green company  and there are other degrees of greenness in between so if your green marketing strategy's gonna work ,  your message should be valid on all dimensions when a company as a whole is credited for reducing its environmental impact ,  this can lead to brand loyalty people will come back and buy your product more and more however ,  let's say you're fine for violating the clean water act while manufacturing products from recycled materials .
SENTENCE the public would eventually find out you can't just make the claim that a product is environmentally friendly and not follow through on  .
