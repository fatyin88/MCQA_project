SENTENCE hi ,  i'm not sure ,  but um   is this the carter language lab ?
SENTENCE yes ,  it is .
SENTENCE how can i help you ?
SENTENCE i'm taking first year spanish this semester .
SENTENCE our professor says we need to come here to view a series of videos .
SENTENCE i think it is called spanish   working on your accent ?
SENTENCE yes ,  we have that .
SENTENCE um   .
SENTENCE they are on the wall behind you .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE so ,  i can just take   .
SENTENCE err    can i take the whole series home ?
SENTENCE i think there arei guess you haven't been here before .
SENTENCE no ,  no i haven't .
SENTENCE ok ,  well ,  you have to watch the videos here .
SENTENCE you need to sign in to reserve an open room and sign out the video you need ,  just start with the first one in the series ,  each video is half an hour long .
SENTENCE so ,  it is a video library ,  basically ?
SENTENCE yes ,  but unlike the library ,  you can't take any videos out of the lab .
SENTENCE ok ,  so how long can i use a video room for ?
SENTENCE you can sign up for two hours at a time .
SENTENCE oh ,  good ,  so i can watch more than one video when i come up here .
SENTENCE is the lab pretty busy all the time ?
SENTENCE well ,  rooms are usually full right after dinner time ,  but you can sign up the day before to reserve a room if you want .
SENTENCE err  the day before   .
SENTENCE but ,  i can just stop in too ,  to see if there's any rooms open ,  right ?
SENTENCE sure ,  stop in any time .
SENTENCE what about copies of the videos ?
SENTENCE is there just one copy of each in the series ?
SENTENCE i don't want to miss out if everyone comes in at once .
SENTENCE oh ,  no ,  we have several copies of each tape in the spanish accent series .
SENTENCE we usually have multiple copies of everything for each video collection .
SENTENCE super .
SENTENCE so  how many rooms are there total in the lab ?
SENTENCE 2  .
SENTENCE they are pretty small .
SENTENCE so ,  we normally get one person or no more than a small group of people in there watching a video together .
SENTENCE actually ,  someone else from your class just came in and took the first spanish video in to watch .
SENTENCE you could probably run in there and watch it with him .
SENTENCE of course ,  you are welcome to have own room .
SENTENCE but ,  sometimes students like to watch with a classmate ,  so they can review the material with each other afterwards .
SENTENCE for example ,  if there was some content they didn't really understand .
SENTENCE i guess i prefer my own room .
SENTENCE i concentrate better by myself and i don't want to miss anything ,  you know ,  and he's probably already started watching it .
SENTENCE no problem ,  we've got a lot of rooms open right now .
SENTENCE when you come in ,  you sign your name on the list and you're assign a room number ,  or if you call in advance ,  then the attendant will tell you your room number ,  if you forget ,  just come in and take a look at the list .
SENTENCE the videos are over there .
