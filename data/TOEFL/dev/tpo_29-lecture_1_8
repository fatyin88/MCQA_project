SENTENCE so far we have covered biodiversity in the hard wood forest here in the upper peninsula of michigan from a number of angles .
SENTENCE we've looked at everything from how biodiversity relates to species stability ,  to competition for forests resources and more .
SENTENCE but now i want to discuss what's called pedodiversity .
SENTENCE pedodiversity is basically soil diversity .
SENTENCE when we analyze pedodiversity within an area ,  we are measuring how much variability there is in soil properties and how many different types of soil there are in a particular area .
SENTENCE so we look at soil chemistry .
SENTENCE for example ,  how much nitrogen or magnesium there's in the soil in one spot .
SENTENCE and we compare it with the chemistry of the soil a short distance away .
SENTENCE until recently ,  there hasn't been a whole lot of attention paid to pedodiversity .
SENTENCE but that's changing rapidly .
SENTENCE more and more studies are being done in these fields .
SENTENCE there's a link between biodiversity and pedodiversity ,  an obvious relationship between soils and flora and fauna ,  which is why pedodiversity really should be considered in forest management .
SENTENCE a high degree of soil variability in a small area is common ,  particularly within forests .
SENTENCE if you compare soils from a forest with soils that don't come from a forest ,  the amount of variability will most likely be greater in the forest's soil .
SENTENCE it generally has more diversity .
SENTENCE um ok .
SENTENCE there are three main causes of pedodiversity within old growth forest here in our region of michigan .
SENTENCE one is tree species .
SENTENCE different species have different influences on soil formation and soil properties .
SENTENCE for example ,  pine trees drop pine needles .
SENTENCE and those needles add a lot of acid to the soil .
SENTENCE the organic litter of another tree species might add less acid but more of something else .
SENTENCE a lot of different types of trees in an area might mean more pedodiversity .
SENTENCE another cause ?
SENTENCE gaps   created when trees fall .
SENTENCE you see ,  where there are gaps ,  open areas in the forest ,  the soil there changes .
SENTENCE um  for instance ,  without a tree to absorb radiation from the sun ,  to offer shade ,  the full intensity of that radiation reaches the ground .
SENTENCE the soil where the tree used to be heats up .
SENTENCE and without a tree to soak up moisture from the ground ,  the soil remains wetter than in the surrounding forest .
SENTENCE with a higher temperature and more moist conditions ,  the process of organic matter decomposition speeds up .
SENTENCE in other words ,  organic matter gets broken down and added into the soil more quickly in these gaps than in the surrounding forest .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE and the third cause trees being uprooted .
SENTENCE when a tree is uprooted ,  it might fall into some other trees on its way down ,  thus falling only partway over .
SENTENCE or it might crash all the way down to the forest floor .
SENTENCE either way ,  if its roots are pulled up from out of the ground as the tree topples over ,  then there's usually a big hole ,  a pit left in the ground where the roots used to be .
SENTENCE and there's still a lot of soil attached to the roots ,  clinging to the roots .
SENTENCE as that soil is eventually shed from the roots by rain and wind and the movement of squirrels climbing around ,  things like that .
SENTENCE um   as the soil is shed ,  it drops down and forms a little hill of dirt ,  a mound .
SENTENCE pits and mounds have significantly different soil properties than other areas in the forest .
SENTENCE you get a redistribution and mixing of soil as deep roots are ripped up from the ground .
SENTENCE rock fragments can be pulled up too ,  if they've gotten entangled with the roots over the years .
SENTENCE so rock fragments from the subsoil can end up concentrated on the surface .
SENTENCE there are forests management implications i want to point out .
SENTENCE forests management impacts soil quality .
SENTENCE and when we better understand pedodiversity ,  we will be better able to predict the impact of forest management on soil .
SENTENCE but in general ,  for positive impact ,  forest management practices should mimic natural forest processes .
SENTENCE and the goal should be to promote pedodiversity ,  and through this ,  biodiversity in general .
SENTENCE i have a handout ,  an article on pedodiversity in a section of forests near here .
SENTENCE i want you to read it ,  because it makes a point that i've only touched on .
SENTENCE from what i have been saying about the causes of pedodiversity ,  you might assume that the relationship between forest dynamics ,  what happens to the trees ,  and pedodiversity is a one way street .
SENTENCE as the article explains ,  forest dynamics affects pedodiversity .
SENTENCE but pedodiversity also affects forest dynamics .
SENTENCE it's worth bearing in mind .
QUESTION what does the professor suggest are the three main causes of pedodiversity in the old growth hardwood forests she discusses
OPTION the uprooting of trees 1
OPTION the existence of gaps 1
OPTION current forest management practices 0
OPTION diversity of tree species 1
