SENTENCE it's every archaeologist's dream to find a lost civilization ,  to make some huge discovery ,  to find artifacts no one else has laid a hand on in millennia .
SENTENCE you might think that this never happens any more ,  given all the research in archaeology that's been done .
SENTENCE but in the late twentieth century ,  archaeologists discovered the remains of a sophisticated people whose settlement might have been the hub of a civilization few people even thought existed .
SENTENCE they found this site at the edge of a desert in turkmenistan ,  in central asia ,  where a series of mounds rise up from the plains .
SENTENCE now ,  you might remember because we've talked about this ,  archaeologists know that mounds such as these are the kinds of geological features that indicate the presence of ancient settlements .
SENTENCE jim ?
SENTENCE um mounds can be different things ,  right ?
SENTENCE some are burial places exactly .
SENTENCE and some are the remains of cities .
SENTENCE the inhabitants would build houses and temples you know ,  what have you .
SENTENCE and over time ,  those buildings would fall down or be torn down and then be built over .
SENTENCE over time ,  generations of building and rebuilding in the same area would result in a large hill the size of a city .
SENTENCE careful excavation and documentation of layers in a mound can reveal a wealth of information about the everyday life of a people in a settlement over many periods of occupation .
SENTENCE now ,  this particular site is called gonur depe .
SENTENCE what was found at gonur depe was amazing  the ruins of a huge palace complex ,  the foundations of shops and houses ,  the remains of thick walls and towers that fortified the city .
SENTENCE there was even an elaborate canal system and a lot of very intricate jewelry .
SENTENCE all these findings seem to indicate that they are the remains of an ancient civilization that was every bit as advanced as other more famous civilizations of the time .
SENTENCE like those in egypt ,  or ,  or china .
SENTENCE and the site dates back to 3 ,     b .
SENTENCE c .
SENTENCE e .
SENTENCE did they trade with those other civilizations ?
SENTENCE because if they did ,  wouldn't there've been some evidence of that ?
SENTENCE you know ,  an artifact found in the ruins of other civilizations ?
SENTENCE that's a good question .
SENTENCE i mentioned jewelry ,  well ,  jewelry have been found in mesopotamia and at archaeological sites in modern day pakistan .
SENTENCE but archaeologists didn't know where it came from .
SENTENCE only after the site at gonur depe was excavated were archaeologists able to identify it as coming from gonur depe .
SENTENCE uh ,  sheryl ?
SENTENCE i wonder why nobody found this site before .
SENTENCE well ,  before the discovery of this site ,  it was commonly believed that central asia had always been occupied by mostly nomadic people .
SENTENCE so there would be no record of major settlements .
SENTENCE a couple of small finds have been made in the area ,  but really ,  no one had looked very hard .
SENTENCE now ,  one mystery regarding this site is that archaeological records show it was inhabited for only a few centuries .
SENTENCE what happened to the people who lived there ?
SENTENCE well ,  the site was close to the murgab river ,  which they would have depended on for their water .
SENTENCE and the murgab river ,  which runs toward the west ,  is the kind of river that shifts its course over time .
SENTENCE so one theory is that the river's course shifted toward the south ,  and they simply followed it and built new towns to the south .
SENTENCE another theory is that they were involved in wars with neighboring settlements .
SENTENCE but we might never know the truth .
SENTENCE one thing we do know is that in the decades since gonur depe was discovered ,  the site has deteriorated significantly .
SENTENCE i mean ,  it's been disturbed for the first time in millennia .
SENTENCE and being exposed to the sun and wind has taken its toll on the ancient city .
SENTENCE so now the question is ,  do we partially restore and rebuild the site before the entire thing disintegrates ?
SENTENCE it will take a lot of funding to restore it and i am not sure it'll be made available ,  which would be a pity .
SENTENCE even a partly altered site can provide valuable information ,  which would be lost otherwise .
