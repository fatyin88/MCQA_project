SENTENCE hi .
SENTENCE sorry .
SENTENCE i'm late .
SENTENCE professor blane .
SENTENCE no problem .
SENTENCE jim .
SENTENCE so you've got some questions about your senior thesis requirement ?
SENTENCE yeah .
SENTENCE i've got a couple of problems actually .
SENTENCE so ,  the first thing is ,  you normally write it during the first half of the academic year .
SENTENCE right ?
SENTENCE in your final year of studies .
SENTENCE but i have my student teaching scheduled for that time .
SENTENCE i want to teach high school english after graduation .
SENTENCE so i really need to give that my full attention .
SENTENCE and i just worry that i won't be able to if i am writing my senior thesis at the same time .
SENTENCE i mean ,  it's supposed to be 35 to 4  pages .
SENTENCE that's a serious commitment .
SENTENCE you are right .
SENTENCE but it really isn't a problem .
SENTENCE no .
SENTENCE a lot of english majors get teacher certification ,  so we have students like you do their senior thesis after their student teaching .
SENTENCE it works out well ,  because many students want to use a unit they taught as the basis of their paper .
SENTENCE so you'll just enroll in a thesis seminar for the second semester .
SENTENCE well ,  that's a big relief .
SENTENCE but it brings us to my second problem .
SENTENCE i'd really focus my studies on old and middle english literature .
SENTENCE i am even thinking about doing a graduate degree with a concentration in that after i taught for a while .
SENTENCE so i was hoping to do my senior thesis on chaucer ,  on the canterbury tales ,  because that would obviously be useful if i do go on .
SENTENCE but  exactly .
SENTENCE professor john is going to be taking a sabbatical to do research in france during the second half of the year .
SENTENCE so without him around ,  i am not sure how i could do a senior thesis on the canterbury tales .
SENTENCE i mean ,  the focus of his teaching and research is unique around here .
SENTENCE yes .
SENTENCE i understand .
SENTENCE it would be difficult to do your paper without professor johnson around .
SENTENCE hmmm  would you allow me to try to sell you on an alternate plan ?
SENTENCE well ,  you can try .
SENTENCE but chaucer is sort of my hero ,  if you know what i mean .
SENTENCE well ,  i am teaching a course on the literature of the renaissance in the first half of the year .
SENTENCE it'll meet late in the day ,  so it won't interfere with your teaching .
SENTENCE and i haven't offered it in quite a while now ,  so i doubt you ever studied that period on the college level .
SENTENCE if you would be interested in taking the course ,  i'd be happy to give you supplemental readings ,  and i'd also be happy to be your advisor for your paper later on .
SENTENCE well ,  i never looked at that area before ,  but i have always had an interest in it .
SENTENCE so that does have a certain appeal .
SENTENCE well ,  if you do decide to go this route ,  i would make that decision soon and i would use this summer productively .
SENTENCE after all ,  this is not going to be like taking an intro course .
