SENTENCE hi .
SENTENCE can you tell me where to find new kind of science ?
SENTENCE by ,  uh ,  by stephen wolfram .
SENTENCE uh ,  i couldn't find it  ok .
SENTENCE let me look it up on the computer for you .
SENTENCE who would you say the author was ?
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE let's see   hmm   no ,  it's not coming up .
SENTENCE hmm   ,  .
SENTENCE i am not seeing it  this is for a course here at the university ,  right ?
SENTENCE yeah ,  it's assigned reading for a class i am taking .
SENTENCE it's for the semester ,  right ?
SENTENCE you are not buying it in advance for next year or anything .
SENTENCE no ,  no .
SENTENCE it's for a class i am taking now .
SENTENCE oh ,  oh ,  you know what ?
SENTENCE um ,  it's for a graduate class .
SENTENCE would that maybe make a difference ?
SENTENCE i mean ,  i am an undergrad ,  but i am just taking this one class in the graduate department ,  so .
SENTENCE no ,  no .
SENTENCE i don't think that's it .
SENTENCE that shouldn't make any difference .
SENTENCE but ,  hmm   let me see   maybe it's just  it could be that whoever that entered it misspelled the title or the author's name ,  so i can't find it on the computer and i can't tell if it's sold out .
SENTENCE but if it's sold out ,  we would probably be getting a new shipment within about a week or so .
SENTENCE well ,  uh ,  i was hoping to get it sooner because like we already have assignments and you know ,  i mean ,  i guess i can get it from the library .
SENTENCE right ,  of course .
SENTENCE but i am trying to check .
SENTENCE if we've ordered more ,  then that back orders information should be in the computer too .
SENTENCE let's see   back order   wolfram ,  stephen   ,  .
SENTENCE no ,  no .
SENTENCE i am not seeing it .
SENTENCE i am sorry .
SENTENCE we just don't seem to carry it .
SENTENCE this is odd though .
SENTENCE what is  what's your professor's name ?
SENTENCE i could try searching for his or her classes in the database .
SENTENCE that might help  um  ok .
SENTENCE it's professor kayne .
SENTENCE no .
SENTENCE it's professor kayne ,  k a y n e .
SENTENCE he's in the computer science department .
SENTENCE oh .
SENTENCE it's for a computer science course ,  is it ?
SENTENCE well ,  that must be it .
SENTENCE computer science books are sold across the street in the computer bookstore .
SENTENCE are there signs up anywhere ?
SENTENCE maybe they should put some up .
SENTENCE it could have save us both some time .
SENTENCE yeah .
SENTENCE well ,  anyway ,  i'll bet that's the problem .
SENTENCE check across the street .
SENTENCE i'll bet they have it .
SENTENCE but if not ,  come back ,  and i'll help you find it somewhere else .
SENTENCE i can call around to see if other bookstores might have it .
SENTENCE ok ?
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE thanks a lot .
SENTENCE bye .
