SENTENCE all right .
SENTENCE i hope you all had a chance to finish the assigned readings about animal play ,  because i want to spend some time discussing the different viewpoints presented in those articles .
SENTENCE let's start with the play as preparation hypothesis .
SENTENCE jerry ,  can you explain it ?
SENTENCE yeah ,  play as preparation .
SENTENCE young animals play in order to get really good at certain specific things they will need to do when they are adults ,  things like chasing ,  pouncing ,  climbing .
SENTENCE in other words ,  they play in order to practice survival skills ,  like movements used in hunting and fighting .
SENTENCE that hypothesis makes a lot of sense ,  like ,  maybe the most sense of all the theories we read about .
SENTENCE and what leads you to that conclusion ?
SENTENCE well ,  like wolves ,  the young pups ,  they fight a lot and bite ,  you know ,  not to hurt each other ,  but    it just seems obvious why those wolf pups play like that .
SENTENCE it gives them practice with skills that will make them better hunters or fighters as adults .
SENTENCE oh ,  i don't know about that .
SENTENCE i mean ,  some of the things a young animal does while playing are totally different from the things they'll do as an adult .
SENTENCE there was a really good example in the second article .
SENTENCE i can't remember what it is called exactly ,  uh ,  self  right .
SENTENCE self handicapping .
SENTENCE like during a fake fight ,  a play fight ,  if one of the animals is winning ,  the winning animal might just stop and give up its advantage .
SENTENCE yes .
SENTENCE and often it shifts to a submissive posture too .
SENTENCE of course self handicapping hardly ever happens in a real fight .
SENTENCE because in a real fight ,  well ,  the point is to win .
SENTENCE so ,  this self handicapping ,  it is important to take this into account before just deciding to go with that first explanation .
SENTENCE and in fact ,  there really isn't much in the way of solid experimental evidence to support the play as preparation hypothesis .
SENTENCE what about the other one ?
SENTENCE the flexibility hypothesis ?
SENTENCE ah ,  yes .
SENTENCE let's talk about that .
SENTENCE as you say ,  play is much more than just pretend fighting or practicing other adult behaviors .
SENTENCE apparently ,  it also contributes to the development of a brain that's flexible ,  a brain that's quickly able to get a handle on unfamiliar situations .
SENTENCE this notion ,  the flexibility hypothesis ,  well ,  many of my colleagues find it quite persuasive .
SENTENCE so ,  like with kids ,  a little kid might play a game with a friend ,  and then they might race each other across the field .
SENTENCE so they are switching from one type of play to another .
SENTENCE there's a lot of variety ?
SENTENCE i mean ,  they are learning to respond to whatever happens ?
SENTENCE well ,  that's the general idea .
SENTENCE but let's hold off on talking about human behaviors from now .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE according to the flexibility hypothesis ,  yes ,  the diversity ,  the variety in play can lead to a broader behavioral vocabulary .
SENTENCE a broader behavioral vocabulary ?
SENTENCE can you explain what that means ?
SENTENCE well ,  sometimes playing results in an animal doing something it would not normally do .
SENTENCE that can lead to the animal learning to adapt ,  to come up with new behaviors that can help it cope with major problems later on ,  like staying safe or finding food .
SENTENCE yeah .
SENTENCE and there was that brain study you had us read about too .
SENTENCE oh ,  the one on how play affects development within the brain ?
SENTENCE right .
SENTENCE that's it .
SENTENCE about the animals raised in an environment where they did not get opportunities to play ?
SENTENCE yes .
SENTENCE wasn't the conclusion interesting ?
SENTENCE that playing literally stimulates growth ,  creates connections within the brain ?
SENTENCE we need to do further studies ,  but  .
SENTENCE excuse me ,  can we go back to play fighting for a minute ?
SENTENCE i am wondering ,  can the flexibility hypothesis really explain that ?
SENTENCE play fighting ?
SENTENCE actually ,  that's something the flexibility hypothesis explains very well .
SENTENCE since play fighting includes variations in speed and intensity ,  and quick role reversals involved with self handicapping .
SENTENCE an animal that's play fighting is constantly responding to changes .
SENTENCE so it's earning to be flexible .
QUESTION the professor discusses a study on the relationship between brain growth and play what does that study conclude
OPTION patterns of brain growth are similar in animals that play and animals that do not play 0
OPTION excessive brain growth can sometimes limit an animal's behavioral vocabulary 0
OPTION animals that do not play have less developed brains than animals that play 1
OPTION animals without well developed brains are seldom observed playing 0
