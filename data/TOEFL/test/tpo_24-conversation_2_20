SENTENCE hi .
SENTENCE paul .
SENTENCE what can i do for you ?
SENTENCE i have a question about the final exam .
SENTENCE i mean ,  will it cover everything we've done all term ?
SENTENCE or just what we've been doing since the mid term exam .
SENTENCE everything we've done all term .
SENTENCE oh ,  boy .
SENTENCE you know ,  i am still not too clear about the hydrologic cycle ,  um ,  the transfer of water back and forth between the earth and the atmosphere .
SENTENCE i really blew the question about it on the mid term exam .
SENTENCE i want to do better on the final exam .
SENTENCE but i am still having trouble with it .
SENTENCE well ,  uh ,  have you been to the tutoring center ?
SENTENCE no ,  not for geography anyway .
SENTENCE isn't that just for when you need help with writing ,  like an essay or a research paper .
SENTENCE oh ,  no .
SENTENCE you can get tutoring in a lot of subjects .
SENTENCE some graduate students from this department tutor there .
SENTENCE that's good to know .
SENTENCE but i hardly go there because i have a part time job .
SENTENCE i never seem to be free when they are open .
SENTENCE well ,  they will be extending their hours when final exams begin .
SENTENCE you might try then .
SENTENCE but um   well ,  since you are here now ,  can i help you with something ?
SENTENCE well ,  the hydrologic cycle .
SENTENCE i remember we went over a diagram in class .
SENTENCE and from what i remember ,  water changes back and forth from water in lakes and oceans to vapor ,  and then back to water again when it falls as rain or snow ,  as precipitation .
SENTENCE it's constantly being recycled through evaporation and condensation .
SENTENCE that's it .
SENTENCE basically .
SENTENCE um   so exactly what is it you don't understand ?
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE i guess what i am really confused about is how the topography of the land ,  the mountains and valleys and stuff ,  affects precipitation .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE good question .
SENTENCE precipitation is influenced by topography among other things .
SENTENCE um ,  why don't we talk about lake effect snow ?
SENTENCE it's a phenomenon that occurs anywhere you have a large lake that doesn't freeze and have cold air flowing over it ,  mostly in the northern hemisphere  like the great lakes in the united states ?
SENTENCE yeah .
SENTENCE what happens is that the cold arctic air blows across the lake from the north in winter .
SENTENCE and as the air crosses the lake ,  the lower layer is warmed by the lake water ,  which is much warmer than the arctic air .
SENTENCE and as this air is warmed and picks up moisture ,  it becomes lighter than the air above it .
SENTENCE so it starts to rise ,  right ?
SENTENCE yes .
SENTENCE and clouds begin to form .
SENTENCE when the air gets closer to the shore ,  it's slowed down by the land and starts to pile up .
SENTENCE so it rises even faster because it has nowhere else to go ,  that's where topography comes into the picture .
SENTENCE and then it snows because as the air rises ,  it cools off and loses its capacity to hold water vapor .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE thanks .
SENTENCE any chance you'll have this question on the final ?
SENTENCE i don't know yet .
SENTENCE but you seem to have a handle on it .
QUESTION what aspect of the hydrologic cycle is the student confused about
OPTION how the process of evaporation works 0
OPTION how topographical features affect precipitation 1
OPTION how water vapor in the atmosphere becomes rain 0
OPTION how lake water fits into the cycle 0
