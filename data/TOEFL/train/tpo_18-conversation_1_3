SENTENCE hi  !
SENTENCE i hope you can help me  .
SENTENCE i just transferred from northeastern state university near chicago .
SENTENCE well welcome to central university  .
SENTENCE but chicago is such a great city .
SENTENCE why did you leave ?
SENTENCE everyone asks that .
SENTENCE it's my hometown .
SENTENCE and it was sure convenient to go to a school nearby .
SENTENCE but northeastern is still fairly small .
SENTENCE and it doesn't have the program i'm interested in .
SENTENCE i want to major in international studies .
SENTENCE and the only program int the state is here .
SENTENCE we do have a great program .
SENTENCE well how did you get interested in international studies ?
SENTENCE my family hosted a few foreign exchange students while i was growing up .
SENTENCE then i took part in an international summer program after i graduated from high school .
SENTENCE i thought i really i like meeting people from all over ,  getting to know them .
SENTENCE oh !
SENTENCE ok !
SENTENCE and that led you to our program .
SENTENCE right now though i think you are looking for a job .
SENTENCE yeah ,  a part time job on campus .
SENTENCE i thought i'd save money  , being away from the big city .
SENTENCE but it doesn't seem to be working that way  .
SENTENCE anyway i'm not having much luck .
SENTENCE i'm not surprised .
SENTENCE most of our campus jobs are taken in the first week or two of the semester .
SENTENCE what work experience have you had ?
SENTENCE well ,  i worked in the university library last year .
SENTENCE but i already checked at the library here .
SENTENCE they said their remaining positions were for work study students getting financial aid .
SENTENCE i've never run into that before .
SENTENCE well ,  i guess each school has its own policies .
SENTENCE uh ,  we really don't have much right now .
SENTENCE you might be better .
SENTENCE if you really want something ,  how are your computer skills ?
SENTENCE about average i'd say .
SENTENCE i helped teach some of the basic computer classes .
SENTENCE northeastern offers for new users ,  if that helps any .
SENTENCE ok ,  the technology support department needs people to work its helpdesk .
SENTENCE it's basically a customer service job ,  answering questions ,  helping people solve their computer proplems , give you a chance to develop your people skills .
SENTENCE something every diplomat needs .
SENTENCE but is there some problem ?
SENTENCE i mean why is the job still open ?
SENTENCE well ,  they have extended hours ,  from 6am to 2am every day .
SENTENCE so they need a large staff .
SENTENCE but right now they only need people early mornings ,  late nights ,  and weekends .
SENTENCE you'd probably end up with a bit of everything rather than a regular spot .
SENTENCE on the bright side you'll probably be able to get some studying done between calls .
SENTENCE at least it could be a start and then you can try for better hours next semester  .
SENTENCE um ,  i see why the hours might be a problem .
SENTENCE but i guess i can't afford to be too picky if i want a job .
SENTENCE still maybe we can work something out  .
