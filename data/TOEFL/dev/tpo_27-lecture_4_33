SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE as you probably know ,  primary colors are ,  theoretically speaking ,  the basic colors from which all other colors can be made .
SENTENCE but as you'll find out when you start working on your painting projects ,  the three primary colors   red ,  blue ,  yellow   don't always make the best secondary colors .
SENTENCE combining red and blue ,  you will probably never get a fantastic violet .
SENTENCE to get a nice violet ,  you'll have to add white .
SENTENCE combining yellow and blue ,  you will almost never get a satisfactory green .
SENTENCE you are better off using a pure green pigment .
SENTENCE the idea of primary colors ,  and specifically the idea of red ,  yellow and blue being the primary colors ,  didn't exist until about 2   years ago .
SENTENCE until then ,  the dominant theory about color was one that had been proposed by isaac newton .
SENTENCE newton gave a scientific and objective explanation of colors .
SENTENCE he used a prism to break white light down into the various colors of the spectrum .
SENTENCE and he theorized ,  rightly so ,  that different colors are essentially different wavelengths of light .
SENTENCE but he made no mention of primary colors .
SENTENCE that idea came from ,  or was at least published by a man named johann wolfgang von goethe .
SENTENCE goethe was a well known author .
SENTENCE he wrote many famous novels ,  plays ,  poems .
SENTENCE so why did he start thinking about colors ?
SENTENCE well goethe was part of the romantic movement in western literature .
SENTENCE and he was a romantic ,  through and through ,  meaning that he explained objects and phenomena in terms of the spiritual ,  emotional impact they had ,  as opposed to explaining them in terms of their scientific nature .
SENTENCE he rejected an objective understanding of color ,  in favor of a more subjective understanding .
SENTENCE he believed that when we see color ,  it stimulates our emotions .
SENTENCE and different colors appeal to or inspire different emotions in different people .
SENTENCE well ,  color theory is used in psychology too .
SENTENCE some psychologists do use their field's version of color theory to diagnose and treat patients .
SENTENCE um  anyway ,  goethe conducted a number of experiments trying to figure out which colors corresponded to which emotions .
SENTENCE and in terms of that goal ,  he wasn't very successful .
SENTENCE but his experiments actually did show a lot about the relationships between colors themselves ,  about how colors change when placed next to other colors ,  about how they interact with one another .
SENTENCE scientists studying optics and chromatics today still marvel at his findings .
SENTENCE but goethe wasn't really able to establish a clear connection between colors and emotions .
SENTENCE then in 18 6 ,  he received a letter from a relatively unknown german artist ,  a painter named philipp otto runge .
SENTENCE in the letter ,  runge outlined his own color theory ,  specifically the connections he made between colors and emotions .
SENTENCE and his ideas about what colors symbolize ,  about the emotions that different colors inspire were based on the colors red ,  yellow and blue .
SENTENCE runge's choice of red ,  yellow and blue had nothing to do with what we know from modern day chromatics ,  it had to do with runge's complex system of symbolism ,  his experience of nature ,  particularly with his experience of the quality of light at various times of the day ,  morning ,  noon and night .
SENTENCE so each color had a specific symbolic value .
SENTENCE well ,  four years later ,  goethe published a book entitled color lesson .
SENTENCE in color lesson ,  goethe coincidently cites the same colors as primary colors .
SENTENCE at this point ,  goethe was already a well known author ,  so he was easily able to popularize this idea of primary colors ,  and specifically the idea of red ,  yellow and blue as the primary colors .
SENTENCE but he didn't mention runge ?
SENTENCE well ,  he did put runge's letter in the book ,  at the end .
SENTENCE but he added a disclaimer implying that runge's letter didn't influence his work .
SENTENCE apparently ,  what goethe was saying was that they just happened to come up with the same theory at the same time .
QUESTION according to the professor, why did runge choose the colors red, yellow, and blues as the three primary colors
OPTION he felt they represented natural light at different times of the day 1
OPTION he noticed that they were the favorite colors of romantic painters 0
OPTION he performed several scientific experiments that suggested those colors 0
OPTION he read a book by goethe and agreed with goethe's choices of colors 0
