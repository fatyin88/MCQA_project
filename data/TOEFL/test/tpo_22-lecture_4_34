SENTENCE so ,  uh ,  if you are a musician in the united states in the early twentieth century ,  where could you work ?
SENTENCE same as now ,  i suppose .
SENTENCE in an orchestra ,  mainly .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE and where would the orchestra be playing ?
SENTENCE uh ,  in a concert hall or a dance hall ?
SENTENCE that's right .
SENTENCE and smaller groups of musicians were needed in theaters as accompaniment to visual entertainment ,  like cabarets and variety shows .
SENTENCE but the largest employer for musicians back then was the film industry ,  especially during the silent film era .
SENTENCE really ?
SENTENCE you mean being a piano player or something ?
SENTENCE i thought movie theaters would have used recorded music .
SENTENCE well ,  no .
SENTENCE not during the silent film era .
SENTENCE we are talking a period of maybe thirty years where working in movie theaters was the best job for musicians .
SENTENCE it was very well paid .
SENTENCE the rapid growth of the film industry meant movie theaters were popping up everywhere .
SENTENCE so suddenly there was this huge demand for musicians .
SENTENCE in fact ,  over 2  ,     jobs for musicians were gone ,  disappeared at the end of the silent film era ,  2  ,     .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE so from the beginning ,  music was a big part of film ,  even at the first   excuse me ,  professor .
SENTENCE i think i read somewhere that they used music to drown out the sound of the film projectors ?
SENTENCE yeah .
SENTENCE that's good story ,  isn't it ?
SENTENCE too bad it keeps getting printed as if it were the only reason music was used .
SENTENCE well ,  think about it .
SENTENCE even if that were the case ,  noisy projectors were separated from the main house pretty quickly ,  yet music continued to accompany film .
SENTENCE so ,  as i was saying ,  even the very first public projection of a film had piano accompaniment .
SENTENCE so music was pretty much always there .
SENTENCE what's strange to me though ,  is that at first film music didn't necessarily correspond to what was on the screen .
SENTENCE you know ,  eh ,  a fast number for a chase ,  deep bass notes for danger ,  something light and humorous for comedy .
SENTENCE and that's instantly recognizable now ,  even expected .
SENTENCE but in the very early days of film ,  any music was played .
SENTENCE a theater owner would just buy a pile of sheet music and musicians will play it ,  no matter what it was .
SENTENCE pretty quickly though ,  thankfully ,  everybody realized the music should suit the film .
SENTENCE so eventually ,  film makers tried to get more control over the musical accompaniment of their films .
SENTENCE ,  and specify what type of music to use and how fast or slow to play it .
SENTENCE are you saying there was no music written specifically for a particular movie ?
SENTENCE yeah .
SENTENCE original scores weren't common then .
SENTENCE rarely a filmmaker might send along an original score composed especially for a film ,  but usually a compilation of music that already existed would be used .
SENTENCE yeah ,  that was a good time for a lot of musicians .
SENTENCE but that all changed with the introduction of sound on film technology .
SENTENCE actually ,  even before that ,  organs could mimic a number of instruments and also do some sound effects .
SENTENCE so they were starting to replace live orchestras in some movie theaters ,  and it only takes one person to play an organ .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE but even after that someone still had to play the music for the sound for the sound recordings ,  the soundtracks .
SENTENCE yeah .
SENTENCE but think of all the movie theaters there were ,  most employing about six to eight musicians ,  some even had full orchestras .
SENTENCE but in the early 193's ,  most theater owners installed new sound systems .
SENTENCE so suddenly a lot of musicians were looking for work .
SENTENCE once recording technology took off ,  studio jobs working exclusively for one film company ,  eh ,  studio jobs did become available .
SENTENCE but the thing is ,  each major movie company pretty much had only one orchestra for all their productions ,  a set number of regular musicians .
SENTENCE so if you could get it ,  studio musician was a good job .
SENTENCE if you were cut out for it ,  musicians had to be able to read music very well ,  since the producers were very conscious of how much money they were spending .
SENTENCE they didn't want to waste any time .
SENTENCE so a musician was expected to play complicated pieces of music pretty much without any preparation .
SENTENCE if one couldn't do it ,  there were plenty of others waiting to try .
SENTENCE so there was a lot of pressure to do well .
QUESTION according to the professor , why was it difficult for musicians to get a job at one of the film studios
OPTION musicians who had played in movie theaters were not usually hired by the film studios 0
OPTION there were more musicians looking for jobs than there were jobs available at the film studios 1
OPTION musicians had to be very talented to meet the demands of the film studios 1
OPTION the film studios preferred musicians who had some acting experience 0
