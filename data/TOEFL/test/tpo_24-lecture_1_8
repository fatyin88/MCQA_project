SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE for today ,  let's look at a reptile ,  a predator that hasn't evolved much in the last seventy million years .
SENTENCE no discussion of reptiles would be complete without some mention of crocodiles .
SENTENCE now ,  we tend to think of crocodiles as ,  uh ,  kind of solitary ,  hiding out in a swamp ,  uh ,  kind of mysterious creatures .
SENTENCE but we are finding out that they aren't as isolated as they seem .
SENTENCE in fact ,  crocodiles interact with each other in a variety of ways .
SENTENCE one way is with vocalizations ,  you know ,  sounds generated by the animal .
SENTENCE this is true of the whole crocodile family ,  which includes crocodiles themselves ,  alligators ,  etc .
SENTENCE take american alligators .
SENTENCE if you were to go to a swamp during the breeding season ,  you'd hear a chorus of sounds ,  deep grunts ,  hisses ,  these are sounds that male alligators make .
SENTENCE and some of them are powerful enough to make the water vibrate .
SENTENCE this sends a strong ,  go away message to the other males .
SENTENCE so the alligator can focus on sending other sound waves through the water ,  sound waves that you and i couldn't even hear since they are at such low frequency .
SENTENCE but they do reach the female alligator ,  who then goes to find and mate with the male .
SENTENCE vocalization is um  well ,  it is used for other reasons ,  like getting attention or just ,  um   letting others know you are distressed .
SENTENCE let's see .
SENTENCE new born crocodiles ,  or hatchlings and their interactions with their mothers .
SENTENCE when they are born ,  croc   baby crocodiles have a sort of muffled cry while they are in their nest .
SENTENCE hatchlings are really vulnerable ,  especially to birds and small mammals when they are born .
SENTENCE but their mother ,  who has been keeping vigil nearby ,  hears their cry for help and carries them to safety ,  meaning ,  to water .
SENTENCE so she takes them out of the nest .
SENTENCE uh ,  uh ,  all the eggs hatched at once ,  so she has about forty newborns to look after .
SENTENCE well ,  she takes about fifteen out of the nest at a time ,  carrying them in her mouth to the nearby water .
SENTENCE while she is taking one load of hatchlings ,  the others wait for her to come back .
SENTENCE but do you think they are quiet about it ?
SENTENCE no way .
SENTENCE they are clamoring for the mother's attention ,  sort of squeaking and practically saying don't forget about me !
SENTENCE i heard some great examples of this on the television program on crocodiles last week .
SENTENCE anyone catched it ?
SENTENCE it had a few interesting bits .
SENTENCE but you know ,  uh ,  you have to be careful ,  think critically .
SENTENCE sometimes i don't know where these shows find their experts .
SENTENCE excuse me .
SENTENCE but ,  um   does all that crying defeat the purpose ?
SENTENCE i mean ,  doesn't it attract more predators ?
SENTENCE hmm  good question .
SENTENCE i guess ,  well ,  i am guessing that once the babies have the mother's attention ,  they are safe .
SENTENCE she's never too far away ,  and ,  and i think  i mean ,  would you mess with a mother crocodile ?
SENTENCE so after the mother transports all the youngsters ,  they still call to each other ,  and to their mother .
SENTENCE this communication continues right through to adulthood .
SENTENCE crocodiles have about eighteen different sounds that they can make .
SENTENCE there's  um  um  you have deep grunting sounds ,  hisses ,  growls ,  are many different sounds to interact or send messages .
SENTENCE this is more typical of mammals than of reptiles .
SENTENCE i mean ,  crocodiles  brains are the most developed of any reptile .
SENTENCE in that sense ,  they are closer to mammals  brains than other reptiles  brains .
SENTENCE and we know that mammals ,  dogs for example ,  dogs vocalize many different sounds .
SENTENCE crocodiles have a similar level of ,  uh ,  vocal sophistication ,  if you will ,  which makes them unique among reptiles .
SENTENCE another thing would be ,  um ,  if a hatchling gets separated from the rest of its family ,  once the others get far enough away ,  its survival instinct kicks in .
SENTENCE it will make a loud distress call ,  which its siblings answer .
SENTENCE it calls again .
SENTENCE and they continue calling back and forth until they all find each other again .
SENTENCE another thing ,  something that wasn't on that tv show i mentioned .
SENTENCE um   mother crocodiles lead their young from one area to another ,  like when they have to find a different source of water .
SENTENCE usually she will lead them at night ,  when it is safer for them ,  moving ahead and then letting out calls of reassurance so that they will follow her .
SENTENCE her voice helps give the babies the courage they need to leave the area and go some place that's a more desirable home for them .
QUESTION based on the discussion, what is one reason hatchlings make vocalizations to their mother while they are in the nest
OPTION to reassure her that they are safe 0
OPTION to signal that they are ready to follow her 0
OPTION to make sure she does not forget them 1
OPTION to indicate that they need to be relocated to a larger nest 0
