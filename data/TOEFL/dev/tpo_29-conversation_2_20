SENTENCE um ,  professor jenkins .
SENTENCE the listening journal you assigned us to keep for the intro to world music class ,  well ,  i am not sure i understand what to do .
SENTENCE i listened to the pieces you assigned this week more than once ,  but when i tried to write about them ,  i didn't know what to say .
SENTENCE well ,  it's not easy to write about music ,  even for people who are supposedly expert at it .
SENTENCE that makes me feel a little better .
SENTENCE but i am just not familiar with how you keep a listening journal .
SENTENCE i've kept journals for other classes ,  summarizing and writing about how i felt about readings .
SENTENCE well ,  a listening journal isn't all that different ,  i want you to note your feelings about musical compositions too .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE there were pieces i like more than others ,  but i think you want our comments to be a little more i don't know ,  analytical .
SENTENCE right ?
SENTENCE well ,  whether you like a piece or not is important ,  but you should be able to explain why you like a particular piece and be able to talk about its historical and musical context .
SENTENCE actually ,  the listening journal is a tool to help you listen to music actively ,  to think about what you are hearing .
SENTENCE maybe i am finding it difficult because i am not real familiar with most of the music you assigned .
SENTENCE i mean ,  if it's hip hop or something i listen to with my friends yes ,  because hip hop is a form that's familiar and meaningful to you .
SENTENCE but you'll see as the semester progresses and you start learning more about musical forms ,  you'll become a more adept listener .
SENTENCE and you'll start noticing patterns .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE so the songs we listened to this week ,  the  the canto ?
SENTENCE the cante jondo  .
SENTENCE you remember we said it means  deep song  in andalusian spanish ?
SENTENCE not only because it's sung in a deep register ,  but also because it's a song about deeper or serious matters ,  certainly not lighthearted .
SENTENCE really ?
SENTENCE hmm i guess i didn't catch the double meaning .
SENTENCE that's kind of cool .
SENTENCE but anyway ,  even with the translations you gave us for the lyrics and everything ,  i don't know ,  i could tell it's sad ,  but i wasn't trying to analyze it ,  from a musical perspective that is .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE so this is what you should do .
SENTENCE go back and listen to the song selection and this time pay attention to the melody ,  to repetition ,  to the  there was plenty of that .
SENTENCE some parts sounded like the same note played over and over again .
SENTENCE that's exactly the kind of observation you would record in a listening journal .
SENTENCE so ,  melody repetition ,  rhythm ,  how the piece is structured ,  as well as your reasons for liking or disliking it .
SENTENCE you know what ?
SENTENCE i thought everyone was clear about this ,  but you've just given me a great idea .
SENTENCE i am going to draw up a list of questions everyone should keep in mind when they are writing their journals .
SENTENCE other students may be having the same problem you are having .
QUESTION why does the student mention hip pop music
OPTION to contrast the ways he responds to familiar and unfamiliar music 1
OPTION to help explain why he signed up for the professor's course 0
OPTION to point out its similarities to music introduced in the course 0
OPTION to give an example of music that features repeating rhythms 0
