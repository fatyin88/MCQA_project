SENTENCE hi .
SENTENCE can i help you ?
SENTENCE where do i go ,  besides the computers ,  to look for books on new zealand ?
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE you mean you don't want to use the computer ?
SENTENCE well ,  i haven't had any luck on the computers here .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE i mean the reason i am asking is you pretty much have to go to the computer to find out where a book is .
SENTENCE but i can help you find it on the computer if you like .
SENTENCE that would be great .
SENTENCE i just spent half an hour and i couldn't find anything .
SENTENCE i know how you feel .
SENTENCE when i first started working here ,  i couldn't find anything either .
SENTENCE so you are looking for information on new zealand ,  is that right ?
SENTENCE is it like travel information that you are looking for ?
SENTENCE uh  no .
SENTENCE actually what i am looking for is information on a volcano in new zealand .
SENTENCE oh .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE because i know a travel agency that specializes in tours in new zealand and australia .
SENTENCE oh .
SENTENCE i'd love to go .
SENTENCE i heard it's beautiful .
SENTENCE yup .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE let's see   ok .
SENTENCE if you want to search the library holdings and don't know the author's name or the exact title of the book or an article ,  you have to set up a keyword search .
SENTENCE it is a special function .
SENTENCE then you can just type in some keywords and let the computer do the search .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE oh ,  how about if we search for volcanoes and new zealand .
SENTENCE it's for a geology class ?
SENTENCE ha !
SENTENCE you must be from professor simpson's class .
SENTENCE oh .
SENTENCE well ,  he is a volcano expert ,  so i thought he might be teaching your class .
SENTENCE no ,  i've heard he is really good though .
SENTENCE yeah .
SENTENCE that's what everyone says .
SENTENCE do you know the name of the volcano ?
SENTENCE sure .
SENTENCE it is r u a p e h u .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE mount ruapehu .
SENTENCE let's see .
SENTENCE so are you a geology major ?
SENTENCE let me guess ,  you have to take a science course and you don't want to have to deal with biology ,  chemistry or physics .
SENTENCE exactly .
SENTENCE but it's actually turned out to be a pretty interesting class .
SENTENCE well ,  that's good .
SENTENCE um  does it have to be a book ?
SENTENCE or could you use a journal article ?
SENTENCE mhmm  no ,  either one would be fine .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE well ,  here's a journal article .
SENTENCE let me check to see if we have it .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE we have the article ,  but it is from 2  1 .
SENTENCE is that ok ,  you think ?
SENTENCE well ,  i'd like to have a look at it .
SENTENCE the focus is really on eruptions in the last five years ,  but it might have some useful background material .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE well ,  let's see what else we can find .
