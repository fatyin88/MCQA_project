SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE let's get going .
SENTENCE today i'm going to talk about how the asteroid belt was discovered .
SENTENCE and  .
SENTENCE i'm going to start by writing some numbers on the board .
SENTENCE here they are  we'll start with zero ,  then 3 ,   .
SENTENCE 6 ,   .
SENTENCE 12 .
SENTENCE uh ,  tell me what i'm doing .
SENTENCE right .
SENTENCE i'm doubling the numbers ,  so 2 times 12 is 24 ,  and the next one i'm going to write after 24 would be  .
SENTENCE 48 .
SENTENCE then 96 .
SENTENCE we'll stop there for now .
SENTENCE uh ,  now i'll write another row of numbers under that .
SENTENCE tell me what i'm doing .
SENTENCE 4 ,  7 ,  1   .
SENTENCE how am i getting this second row ?
SENTENCE adding 4 to the numbers in the first row .
SENTENCE i'm adding 4 to each number in the first row to give you a second row .
SENTENCE so the last two will be 52 ,  1   ,  and now tell me what i'm doing .
SENTENCE yes ,  i divided all those numbers by 1  by putting in a decimal point .
SENTENCE now i'm going to write the names of the planets under the numbers .
SENTENCE mercury  .
SENTENCE venus .
SENTENCE earth .
SENTENCE mars .
SENTENCE so ,  what do the numbers mean ?
SENTENCE do you remember from the reading ?
SENTENCE is it the distance of the planets from the sun ?
SENTENCE right .
SENTENCE in astronomical units not perfect ,  but tantalizingly close .
SENTENCE the value for mars is off by  .
SENTENCE 6 or 7 percent or so .
SENTENCE it's  .
SENTENCE but it's within 1  percent of the average distance to mars from the sun .
SENTENCE but i kind of have to skip the one after mars for now .
SENTENCE then jupiter's right there at 5 point something ,  and then saturn is about 1  astronomical units from the sun .
SENTENCE um ,  well ,  this pattern is known as bode's law .
SENTENCE um ,  it isn't really a scientific law ,  not in the sense of predicting gravitation mathematically or something ,  but it's attempting a pattern in the spacing of the planets ,  and it was noticed by bode hundreds of years ago .
SENTENCE well ,  you can imagine that there was some interest in why the 2 .
SENTENCE 8 spot in the pattern was skipped ,  and um  .
SENTENCE but there wasn't anything obvious there ,  in the early telescopes .
SENTENCE then what happened in the late 17  s ?
SENTENCE the discovery of  .
SENTENCE the next planet out ,  uranus after saturn .
SENTENCE and look ,  uranus fits in the next spot in the pattern pretty nicely ,  um ,  not perfectly ,  but close .
SENTENCE and so then people got really excited about the validity of this thing and finding the missing object between mars and jupiter .
SENTENCE and telescopes ,  remember ,  were getting better .
SENTENCE so people went to work on finding objects that would be at that missing distance from the sun ,  and then in 18 1 ,  the object ceres was discovered .
SENTENCE and ceres was in the right place the missing spot .
SENTENCE uh ,  but it was way too faint to be a planet .
SENTENCE it looked like a little star .
SENTENCE uh ,  and because of its starlike appearance ,  um ,  it was called an  asteroid .
SENTENCE ok ?
SENTENCE aster  is greek for  star ,   as in  astronomy .
SENTENCE um ,  and so ,  ceres was the first and is the largest of what became many objects discovered at that same distance .
SENTENCE not just one thing ,  but all the objects found at that distance from the asteroid belt .
SENTENCE so the asteroid belt is the most famous success of this bode's law .
SENTENCE that's how the asteroid belt was discovered .
QUESTION how does the professor introduce bode's law
OPTION by demonstrating how it is derived mathematically 1
OPTION by describing the discovery of uranus 0
OPTION by drawing attention to the inaccuracy of a certain pattern 0
OPTION by telling the names of several of the asteroids 0
