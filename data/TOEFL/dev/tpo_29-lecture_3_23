SENTENCE we will be looking at the original settlement of the americas next ,  and i'll spend the next few classes talking about the clovis people and the two big questions archaeologists have about them .
SENTENCE the two big questions are ,  when did the clovis people arrive in the americas ?
SENTENCE and of course ,  were they the first people in the western hemisphere .
SENTENCE and we'll get to that .
SENTENCE but for today ,  let's try to get an idea about ,  well ,  a question that's not addressed as much as the others and that's   what was their culture like ?
SENTENCE and how do we figure that out ?
SENTENCE now ,  again ,  there's a great debate about when the clovis people first arrived in the americas .
SENTENCE and i am not like a lot of archaeologists who want to push the number way back ,  so let's use a round number and probably a safe number and say 11 ,     years ago .
SENTENCE the clovis people were likely settling north america 11 ,     years ago .
SENTENCE and leave it at that for now .
SENTENCE now ,  most of what we know about the clovis people comes from one of their tools the clovis point .
SENTENCE when we talk about a point we are referring to a piece of stone that's worked to a sharp point ,  in this case probably to be attached to a spear .
SENTENCE the clovis point may be the most analyzed artifact in archaeology .
SENTENCE and the point used by clovis people differs slightly from later points ,  in the way that the base of the stone is thinned ,  uh ,  it's thinner toward the base ,  the part that's attached to the spear .
SENTENCE so when one is found ,  it's usually not confused with points made by later groups .
SENTENCE clovis points have been discovered at both hunting grounds and camp sites ,  which you might expect .
SENTENCE but another fascinating place we find them is in clovis caches .
SENTENCE a cache is just something stored or hidden away .
SENTENCE it's also the term for the place where it's hidden .
SENTENCE the clovis caches are collections of tools ,  stone points and other tools made of stone or bone ,  often at various stages of manufacturing ,  some were left unfinished .
SENTENCE the traditional explanation is that these were emergency supplies ,  uh ,  meant to be used at a later time .
SENTENCE since the clovis people were highly mobile ,  it's plausible that they would set up spots along established travel routes where they keep a variety of items .
SENTENCE either so that they wouldn't have to carry everything with them or so they could save time once they arrived at a site by not having to make stuff from scratch .
SENTENCE but there's another theory about the caches based on the quality of some of the points we've found .
SENTENCE you see ,  the points in some caches differ from other points ,  from points at clovis camp sites for example .
SENTENCE for one thing ,  these cache points are quite large ,  up to twice as large as regular points ,  so big that you couldn't attach one to a spear say ,  and expect to throw the spear accurately over any distance .
SENTENCE so what were they for ?
SENTENCE well ,  it was originally thought that they were unfinished ,  that someone was working away a point ,  then had to stop and put it aside in one of these caches to work on later .
SENTENCE the problem is  it's unlikely that a point would have started out as large as the points in these caches ,  that would be a lot of stone to chip away .
SENTENCE a toolmaker starts with a smaller piece .
SENTENCE and actually ,  far from being unfinished ,  a lot of these points really show excellent craftsmanship and attention to detail .
SENTENCE and not just with respect to the skill ,  but also with respect to the raw material ,  it seems that cached points are made from the very best pieces of stone .
SENTENCE so we have to ask could these points have served another purpose ?
SENTENCE maybe be they weren't just tools .
SENTENCE look at it this way .
SENTENCE when the clovis people first arrived in the americas ,  they had a lot to learn about their new environment .
SENTENCE over time ,  they would have begun to recognize some places as special ,  important for some reason .
SENTENCE maybe there was always water available there .
SENTENCE or the hunting was especially good .
SENTENCE so maybe the cache was a way to mark the place as significant .
