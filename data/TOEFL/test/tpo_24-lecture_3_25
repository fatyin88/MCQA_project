SENTENCE ,  north america was populated by a wide variety of great beasts ,  like mammoth and mastodons ,  both elephant like creatures with big tusks ,  and camels ,  giant sloths ,  the list goes on .
SENTENCE by about 1  ,     b .
SENTENCE c .
SENTENCE e .
SENTENCE ,  all those giant creatures ,  the metgauna of north america were gone .
SENTENCE we don't know exactly what happened to them ,  but there are some theories .
SENTENCE one theory is that they were hunted to extinction by humans .
SENTENCE the humans who coexisted with these giant species in north america at that time were what we today called the clovis peopple .
SENTENCE and there is a clovis site in a valley in southern california where the remains of thirteen mammoths were found .
SENTENCE and spear points ,  tools for processing meat ,  and fire places .
SENTENCE that would appear to be some pretty compelling evidences .
SENTENCE mammoth bones have also been found at some other clovis sites .
SENTENCE but then at other clovis sites ,  there's also a lot of evidence that the clovis people mostly gather plants and hunted small game ,  like rabbits and wild turkeys .
SENTENCE also there are several places in north america where you have natural accumulations of mammoth bones that look very similar to the accumulations at the clovis site ,  except there's no human debris ,  where the mammoth almost certainly died as a result of some kind of natural disaster .
SENTENCE so i think it is quite likely that those thirteen mammoths in southern california also died of natural causes ,  and that the clovis people simply took advantage of the situation .
SENTENCE um  ok .
SENTENCE that's the hunting theory .
SENTENCE now let's look at another theory ,  uh ,  an alternative to the hunting theory ,  the climate change theory .
SENTENCE at around 11 , 5   b .
SENTENCE c .
SENTENCE e .
SENTENCE the world was coming out of an ice age  .
SENTENCE and with that came increased seasonality ,  that is ,  the summers became warmer ,  and the winters actually became colder .
SENTENCE these extreme shifts would have put a lot of stress on the bodies of animals that were used to a more moderate range of temperatures .
SENTENCE but the most important impact of this increased seasonality may very well have been its effect on the distribution of plants .
SENTENCE today we take for granted that there horizontal bands of plant communities .
SENTENCE in the far north ,  it is tundra ,  which gives way to forest as you move southward .
SENTENCE and even farther south ,  grasslands take over .
SENTENCE but during the ice age ,  these plant communities actually grew together ,  mixed with one another .
SENTENCE so ice age animals had access to many different types of plants ,  different types of food .
SENTENCE but when the seasons became more distinct ,  the plant communities were pulled apart ,  that meant ,  in any given area ,  there was less plant diversity .
SENTENCE and as a result ,  uh ,  so the theory goes ,  the ice age animals that depended on plant diversity couldn't survive .
SENTENCE and the great beasts were the ones that needed the most diversity in their diet .
SENTENCE again ,  we have what at first seems like a pretty attractive theory ,  but then ,  how do you explain the fact that this has happened before ?
SENTENCE you know ,  global cooling followed by global warming ,  and there was no extinction then .
SENTENCE uh ,  you know ,  i recently read an interesting article about an archaeologist who tried to solve this puzzle with the help of his computer .
SENTENCE what he did was ,  he wrote a computer program to simulate what would happen to mammoth under certain conditions .
SENTENCE say ,  for example ,  there is a drought for a couple of decades ,  or hunters are killing or five percent of the population ,  and so on .
SENTENCE one thing he found was that humans didn't necessarily have to kill these animals in great numbers in order to nudge them toward extinction .
SENTENCE that's because very large animals have a slow rate of reproduction ,  so all you have to do is remove a few young females from the herd ,  and you can ,  fairly quickly ,  significantly reduce the population .
SENTENCE and then he came up with a scenario that combined some hunting by humans with some environmental stress ,  and  bang !
SENTENCE the simulated mammoths were extinct within decades .
SENTENCE so it seems the mixture of hunting and climate change is a likely scenario .
SENTENCE uh ,  of course ,  computer simulations are not a substitute for hard evidence .
QUESTION what is the professor's opinion about the clovis people
OPTION their excessive hunting of mammoths was responsible for the extinction of these animals 0
OPTION their lack of tools for processing meat contradicts the hunting theory 0
OPTION they were less accomplished at hunting mammoths than the hunting theory suggests 1
OPTION they were probably too afraid of large animals to hunt them 0
