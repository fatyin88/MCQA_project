SENTENCE okay .
SENTENCE so ,  uh ,  to continue our discussion  when philosophers talk about the basis of knowledge ,  they don't mean the source of information about any particular subject .
SENTENCE they mean how we know what we know .
SENTENCE let's start with one philosophical view foundationalism .
SENTENCE foundationalism is the view that our knowledge claims ,  what we think we know ,  that is ,  they need to have a base .
SENTENCE and think of knowledge as a house ,  you need a solid foundation on which to build your house .
SENTENCE and if you have a strong foundation ,  your house is more likely to be solid .
SENTENCE well ,  foundationalists think the same thing is true of knowledge .
SENTENCE if you have a solid base for your knowledge claims ,  then your knowledge structure is more likely to be strong ,  valid ,  true .
SENTENCE first ,  you need some good foundational knowledge claims ,  and then the rest of the knowledge claims can be based on these .
SENTENCE now ,  as to what kinds of knowledge claims are foundational ,  well ,  that's where this gets particularly interesting ,  in fact it sort of depends on which philosopher you ask .
SENTENCE take john locke for instance .
SENTENCE locke's viewpoint essentially was that when humans are born ,  their minds are like blank slates ,  that is ,  we don't have any kind of knowledge when we are born .
SENTENCE we get our knowledge from our senses ,  you know ,  taste ,  touch ,  smell ,  sight ,  hearing .
SENTENCE so ,  when we look at the world ,  first as babies and then as we grow ,  that's where our knowledge comes from .
SENTENCE our senses ,  our experiences serve as the foundation for our knowledge .
SENTENCE now ,  for a very different view ,  let's turn to another philosopher ren  descartes .
SENTENCE descartes thought that you have to go much deeper to find the foundations .
SENTENCE he believed that our senses are not to be trusted .
SENTENCE so he wanted to find a more solid foundation for knowledge .
SENTENCE he began with what has come to be called methodological doubt .
SENTENCE and when we say methodological doubt ,  well   descartes believed that everything should be questioned ,  that is ,  approach it with doubt and that if you could find one thing that cannot be false ,  that one thing would serve as a foundation for all other knowledge claims .
SENTENCE so unlike john locke ,  descartes doubts that knowledge comes to him from his senses .
SENTENCE he points out that at some time or another ,  everyone has been deceived by their senses .
SENTENCE we have all had experiences where our senses have been wrong illusions ,  perhaps ,  mirages .
SENTENCE when driving in a car on a hot summer day ,  you may see what looks like shimmering water on the road ,  which ,  as science tells us ,  is really just a mirage ,  an illusion caused by the heating of the air .
SENTENCE our senses are wrong ,  they've deceived us .
SENTENCE and descartes thinks that since our senses can deceive us ,  we ought not take for granted that what they tell us is really true .
SENTENCE that's the first step in his methodological doubt .
SENTENCE from there he wonders ,  well ,  ok ,  i can doubt my senses ,  but can i doubt that i am sitting in this room ?
SENTENCE can it seem that we are not really here ?
SENTENCE that we are somewhere else ?
SENTENCE he conceives that most of us would know that we are sitting in the room .
SENTENCE but then he says ,  well ,  couldn't i just be dreaming ?
SENTENCE he's had dreams that were so real that he thought he was awake when in fact he was actually asleep .
SENTENCE and this is another good point .
SENTENCE it's really hard to be sure that you are not actually dreaming .
SENTENCE yet another proof for descartes that we can't always trust what our senses are apparently telling us .
SENTENCE we could be dreaming .
SENTENCE and there's really no good way to prove that we are not .
SENTENCE so the common sense picture of reality ,  that the world is really the way it looks to us ,  descartes shows that we cannot just assume this to be true beyond all doubt .
SENTENCE and he does this by talking about illusions and also by arguing that we could be dreaming .
SENTENCE but consider this ,  he says ,  while one is thinking or doubting ,  or doing any of those sorts of mental activities ,  one has to exist ,  right ?
SENTENCE to even think that i doubt that i exist ,  you have to exist !
SENTENCE and so what descartes has done is find at least one thing that he can be certain of .
SENTENCE he says ,   i exist .
SENTENCE and that's a start .
SENTENCE and other knowledge he tells us can be based on that foundation .
QUESTION according to descartes, what type of belief should serve as a foundation for all other knowledge claims
OPTION a belief that is consistent with what one sees and hears 0
OPTION a belief that most other people share 0
OPTION a belief that one has held since childhood 0
OPTION a belief that cannot be false 1
