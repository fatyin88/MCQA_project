SENTENCE well ,  you know ,  i am writing that paper about whales and the path they travel as they swim through the ocean ,  their migration patterns .
SENTENCE and well ,  i was thinking about it and i realized i don't understand how they hold their breath underwater .
SENTENCE lt's a little crazy for me to be writing about migration patterns without actually knowing how they stay underwater for so long .
SENTENCE did you do any research to find out how they do it ?
SENTENCE yeah ,  i did .
SENTENCE i searched on the internet and there was a lot of information about whales ,  their habitats ,  the way they communicate ,  you know ,  their songs .
SENTENCE but if there was anything about whales and how they hold their breath ,  i missed it .
SENTENCE i've got a bunch of books .
SENTENCE actually ,  i have got so much information ,  it's a little overwhelming .
SENTENCE i am surprised there is nothing about it in any of those books .
SENTENCE well ,  to be honest ,  l've only skimmed them so far .
SENTENCE i am still working on finding sources .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE i know i encourage everyone in class to look at a substantial number of sources ,  but i don't want you to get overwhelmed .
SENTENCE looking at a number of sources gives you a good knowledge base ,  but students only have a limited amount of time to work on each paper .
SENTENCE i don't expect you to read a dozen books on whales for this assignment .
SENTENCE focus on just a few .
SENTENCE you know ,  since you are already here .
SENTENCE i can give you a quick summary of how whales hold their breath underwater .
SENTENCE lt's just a matter of certain adaptations in their anatomies ,  specifically in their circulatory system .
SENTENCE so the blood flow is what makes the difference ?
SENTENCE yes ,  and in a couple of ways .
SENTENCE first ,  blood makes up a larger share of a whale's weight than in other mammals .
SENTENCE so they can store more oxygen because they have more blood ?
SENTENCE yes ,  but that's only part of it .
SENTENCE they also have a greater capacity than land animals to store oxygen in their blood .
SENTENCE so how does having more oxygen in their blood help them stay underwater longer ?
SENTENCE it's the way the whale's blood carries oxygen to the rest of its body .
SENTENCE whales carefully conserve their oxygen when underwater in a couple of ways .
SENTENCE when a whale dives ,  its metabolic rate drops ,  causing its heartbeat to slow down .
SENTENCE and the blood flow to its muscles and some of its non vital organs ,  like its kidneys ,  is also cut off .
SENTENCE a whale's muscles and non vital organs are able to function without oxygen for an extended period of time .
SENTENCE i see .
SENTENCE well ,  now i can concentrate on my topic .
QUESTION according to the professor, how does a whale conserve oxygen while underwater
OPTION its heart rate decreases 1
OPTION its lung capacity temporarily increases 0
OPTION it slows the pace of its swimming 0
OPTION blood flow to certain organs is decreased 1
