SENTENCE as we have been studying ,  ballet ,  the classical ballet ,  is based on formalized movements ,  specific positioning of the arms ,  feet and the body .
SENTENCE so ,  now let's move on to modern dance ,  also known as theatrical dance .
SENTENCE modern dance evolved in the late nineteenth ,  early twentieth century ,  and in most cases ,  audiences were very receptive to this radical new type of performing art .
SENTENCE um   what made modern dance so radical ?
SENTENCE well ,  for example ,  i think the best analogy to modern dance is modern art or modern music .
SENTENCE compared to their classical predecessors ,  these newer art forms are freer ,  more experimental ,  more improvisational .
SENTENCE modern dance seeks to show how deep emotions and the music itself ,  how these intangible attributes can affect and inspire physical movement ,  and how movement can convey emotions to the audience .
SENTENCE as i said ,  in classical ballet ,  emotions are conveyed through a set of strictly formalized movements .
SENTENCE now ,  a pioneer of modern dance was isadora duncan ,  who was born in 1878 .
SENTENCE isadora duncan did study ballet briefly as a child ,  but she quickly developed her own unique style ,  which she called free dance .
SENTENCE and by age fourteen ,  she was teaching her free dance to young children and giving recitals .
SENTENCE her early dance technique was loosely based on the natural movements of children ,  running ,  skipping ,  acting out stories ,  also on motions from nature ,  waves crashing onto shore ,  trees swaying in the wind .
SENTENCE her expressive gestures were motivated from within rather than from being dictated by strict technique .
SENTENCE duncan also wore her hair down ,  ballerinas typically wear their hair in a tight bun behind the head .
SENTENCE and instead of the short steep skirts and rigid toeshoes worn by ballerinas ,  duncan wore loose ,  flowing tunics ,  and she dance bare foot .
SENTENCE now ,  that was something her audiences had never seen before .
SENTENCE duncan performed in paris composers ,  but avoiding set audiences ,  for the most part ,  and other european cities ,  dancing to the music of classical movements and steps ,  no two performances were alike .
SENTENCE and adored her .
SENTENCE in 19 4 ,  she opened a school of modern dance in berlin .
SENTENCE and the next year she performed in russia .
SENTENCE but the russian critics were not really kind .
SENTENCE some said duncan's art form was closer to pantomime than to dance .
SENTENCE but her style was a clear rebellion against ballet ,  and ballet is extremely important in russia .
SENTENCE a question ,  julie ?
SENTENCE yeah .
SENTENCE what did duncan have against ballet ?
SENTENCE i mean ,  she studied it as a child .
SENTENCE as a youngster ,  she might have found it too restrictive ,  uh ,  not creative enough .
SENTENCE i think that feeling is exemplied by something that happened earlier in her career ,  in russia .
SENTENCE duncan attended a ballet ,  and the lead dancer was the renowned russian ballerina ana pavlova .
SENTENCE the following day ,  pavlova invited duncan to watch her practice .
SENTENCE duncan accepted but was appalled by what she saw .
SENTENCE to her ,  the exercises that pavlova and the other ballerinas were doing seemed painful ,  even harmful ,  standing on tiptoe for hours ,  moving their bodies in unnatural ways .
SENTENCE after seeing this ,  duncan publically denounced ballet as a form of acrobatics ,  uh ,  complicated and excruciating mechanism she called it .
SENTENCE this critic generated i think some undue rivalry between ballet and modern dance ,  and it would take a long time ,  many years in fact ,  for the rivalry to calm down .
