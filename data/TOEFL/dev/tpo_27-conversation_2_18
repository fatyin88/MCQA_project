SENTENCE would it be okay to focus on something related to agriculture ?
SENTENCE sure ,  farming technology is fine ,  as long as it's pre modern .
SENTENCE but this isn't a long paper ,  so are you going to need to pick a specific area of pre modern agriculture ,  like irrigation or food crops of ancient greece .
SENTENCE i am actually interested in hydroponics .
SENTENCE hydroponics .
SENTENCE growing plants in water instead of soil .
SENTENCE well ,  not in pure water ,  in water that has the proper mix of nutrients .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE but is it a pre modern technology ?
SENTENCE i mean ,  hydroponics isn't really my specialty but from the research i have read ,  we are talking the nineteenth century ,  maybe the seventeenth century if you really stretch it .
SENTENCE oh ?
SENTENCE but the aztec civilization back in the thirteenth century in basically where mexico city is today   an article i read said the aztecs were using hydroponics in something they called   i have got the word right here .
SENTENCE um .
SENTENCE chinampas .
SENTENCE chinampas ,  the so called floating gardens .
SENTENCE exactly .
SENTENCE so yeah the chinampas ,  the article said very clearly these floating gardens are proof that the aztec invented hydroponic farming .
SENTENCE well ,  chinampas are artificial islands built up in shallow lakes .
SENTENCE islands made from packed earth and weeds and uh ,  material from the bottom of the lake .
SENTENCE they may have appeared to be floating in the water ,  but in fact they reach all the way to the bottom of the lake .
SENTENCE so the primary growing medium ,  what the plants draw nutrients from ,  is actually soil ,  not water .
SENTENCE so the article was wrong about that ?
SENTENCE too bad ,  it seems like a great topic ,  but i guess wait a minute .
SENTENCE just because chinampas were not technically hydroponic doesn't mean this couldn't be an appropriate topic for your paper .
SENTENCE chinampas were still a great technological achievement .
SENTENCE i mean ,  they enabled the aztecs to grow plenty of food in an area without much available farmland .
SENTENCE but i wondered why the author wrote that chinampas were hydroponic .
SENTENCE well it's pretty common for writers to generalize ,  say use a term like hydroponics to describe other types of agriculture .
SENTENCE personally ,  i would never say hydroponic except for plants growing in liquid .
SENTENCE the crops on chinampas definitely benefited from the water surrounding them .
SENTENCE but  hydroponic ok .
SENTENCE so i will go with chinampas but leave out with the hydroponics part .
SENTENCE actually ,  there's an important lesson here .
SENTENCE we should pay attention to what happened in history but also how historical events are presented .
SENTENCE why ,  for example ,  would writers use a word like hydroponics so casually ?
SENTENCE i guess  cause it's a popular topic people want to read about ?
SENTENCE or to help modern day readers to understand something historical ,  maybe these writers think a familiar frame of reference is needed .
SENTENCE well that article was in a popular magazine ,  not a scholarly journal for historians .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE but historians sometimes do the same thing .
SENTENCE so i guess then that all historians might not describe chinampas in quite the same way either .
SENTENCE good point .
SENTENCE why not look into that too ?
SENTENCE and include it along with your description and analysis .
