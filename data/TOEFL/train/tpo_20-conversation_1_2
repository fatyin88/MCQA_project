SENTENCE excuse me ,  i received a letter that i am supposed to return a book that i checked out back in september  ,  it's called modern social problems .
SENTENCE but i am writing my senior thesis ,  so i thought i was allowed to keep the book for the whole academic year  .
SENTENCE so you signed up for extended borrowing privileges ?
SENTENCE and we are still asking you to bring the book back ?
SENTENCE uh huh .
SENTENCE do i really have to ?
SENTENCE well ,  let me check the computer  .
SENTENCE the title was    modern social problems ?
SENTENCE eh   ok ,  yeah .
SENTENCE it's been recalled .
SENTENCE you can keep it all year as long as no one else requests it ,  but someone else has ,  it looks like one of the professors in the sociology department .
SENTENCE so you have to bring it back .
SENTENCE you can check it out again when it is returned in a couple of weeks .
SENTENCE what if the person renews it ?
SENTENCE and i really need it right now .
SENTENCE all of it ?
SENTENCE or is there a certain section or chapter you are working with ?
SENTENCE well ,  there's one chapter in particular i am working with ,  but why ?
SENTENCE well ,  we normally don't do this ,  but because of the circumstances we can photocopy up to one chapter for you .
SENTENCE why don't you do that for the one you are working with right now ?
SENTENCE and by the time you need the rest of the book ,  maybe it'll have been returned .
SENTENCE oh ,  that would be great .
SENTENCE do you have it with you ?
SENTENCE eh   no ,  it's in my dorm room .
SENTENCE these are books i want to check out today .
SENTENCE is it ok if i bring that one by in a couple of days ?
SENTENCE actually ,  the due day is tomorrow .
SENTENCE after that ,  there'll be a two dollar per day fine .
SENTENCE but you need to return it today if you want to check out any books today .
SENTENCE that's our policy .
SENTENCE yeah ,  not a lot of people realize that .
SENTENCE in fact ,  every semester we get a few students who would have their borrowing privileges suspended completely because they haven't returned books .
SENTENCE they are allowed to use books only in the library .
SENTENCE they are not allowed to check anything out because of unreturned books .
SENTENCE that's not good .
SENTENCE i guess i should head back to the dorm right now .
SENTENCE but before you go ,  what you should do is fill out a form requesting the book back in two weeks .
SENTENCE then the person who requested it won't be able to renew it .
SENTENCE you'll get it back quickly .
SENTENCE i'll do that right now .
QUESTION what will the man probably do today
OPTION get photocopies of a book chapter 1
OPTION find out who requested his book 0
OPTION borrow additional books 1
OPTION renew the book modern social problems 0
