SENTENCE i'm here  cause   well ,  there's something i don't understand .
SENTENCE i set an announcement for an event .
SENTENCE and this morning i checked the events section of the university's website .
SENTENCE and nothing ,  there is no mention of it .
SENTENCE and when did you summit this request ?
SENTENCE last wednesday .
SENTENCE i followed the instructions very carefully .
SENTENCE i am sure it was wednesday ,  because know announcements have be submitted three business days ahead of the posting day .
SENTENCE yes .
SENTENCE a poetry reading .
SENTENCE oh ,  ok .
SENTENCE when is it ?
SENTENCE in three days .
SENTENCE it is an author from france we have been trying to get for a while .
SENTENCE and now that he has finally agreed to come ,  no one will be there .
SENTENCE wow .
SENTENCE this person is really coming all the way from france ?
SENTENCE oh ,  no .
SENTENCE he is teaching promising there will be in new york city this year .
SENTENCE we were able to sell him on a nice size crowd  ,  felt confident about that .
SENTENCE because the idea by i know how enthusiastic our group is .
SENTENCE and your group  ?
SENTENCE do you have a name ?
SENTENCE um  ?
SENTENCE it is kind of a loose group ,  you know ,  just a bunch of s in the french department who are interested in french literature .
SENTENCE there's no formal structure or anything .
SENTENCE i guess you could call us the french literature reading group .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE and it is a recognized group ?
SENTENCE by the university ,  i mean .
SENTENCE but the french department is funding this ,  on the condition that we do all the legwork .
SENTENCE all right .
SENTENCE hold on a second while i check .
SENTENCE well ,  it looks like we did receive your announcement last wednesday .
SENTENCE uh ,  looks like the editors must have decided not to include your event in this week's listings .
SENTENCE well ,  we don't post things automatically .
SENTENCE we get so many requests that we couldn't possibly post them all .
SENTENCE so events that are thought to be too specialized ,  without the potential for really wide appeal     wow ,  i got to say that does surprise me .
SENTENCE what am i going to do now ?
SENTENCE i mean ,  he really is quite famous .
SENTENCE i really do think there would be a genuine interest beyond my group .
SENTENCE it would be a shame if no one shows up because there isn't enough publicity .
SENTENCE is there anyone else i can talk to ?
SENTENCE i don't think that would do you much good since we are already working on next week's schedule .
SENTENCE but maybe you could ask the french department to post the announcement on its website .
SENTENCE and maybe you could approach some other departments as well ,  you know ,  relevant ones .
SENTENCE i knew we should have done a poster .
SENTENCE but everybody was like ,  oh ,  you can just post it online .
SENTENCE in any event ,  thanks for you help .
SENTENCE it's something to consider .
