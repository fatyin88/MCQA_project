SENTENCE basically ,  a cloud either contributes to the cooling of earth's surface or to its heating .
SENTENCE earth's climate system is constantly trying to strike a balance between the cooling and warming effects of clouds .
SENTENCE it's very close ,  but overall the cumulative effects of cloud are to cool earth rather than heat it .
SENTENCE and this balance between the amount of solar radiation ,  energy from the sun ,  that's absorbed by earth ,  and the amount that's reflected back into space .
SENTENCE we call this earth's radiation budget .
SENTENCE and one way we keep track of the radiation budget is by looking at the albedo of the different surfaces on the planet .
SENTENCE a surface's albedo is the percentage of incoming solar energy ,  sunlight ,  that's reflected off that surface back into space .
SENTENCE oceans have a low albedo ,  because they reflect very little energy .
SENTENCE most of the solar energy that reaches the ocean gets absorbed and heats the water .
SENTENCE um   rainforests also have low albedos .
SENTENCE well ,  by contrast ,  deserts and areas covered by ice and snow ,  these places have high albedos .
SENTENCE and clouds ,  in general ,  cloud also have high albedos .
SENTENCE that means that a large percentage of the solar energy clouds receive is reflected into space .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE now ,  when we say that clouds have a high albedo .
SENTENCE we are talking about the effect of all the clouds on earth averaged together .
SENTENCE but different types of clouds have different reflective properties ,  they have different albedos .
SENTENCE so which type of clouds cools earth ?
SENTENCE and which type heat it ?
SENTENCE well ,  high thin clouds contribute to heating while low thick clouds cool earth .
SENTENCE high thin clouds are very transparent to solar radiation ,  like ,  uh ,  clear air .
SENTENCE so they mostly transmit incoming solar energy down to earth .
SENTENCE there's not much reflection going at all .
SENTENCE at the same time ,  these clouds trap in some of earth's heat .
SENTENCE because of the trapped heat ,  these clouds have an overall heating effect .
SENTENCE oh .
SENTENCE ok .
SENTENCE since low thick clouds are not transparent to radiation     exactly .
SENTENCE they block most of the solar energy so it never reaches earth's surface .
SENTENCE they reflect much of it back out into space .
SENTENCE so that's how they contribute to cooling ?
SENTENCE yep .
SENTENCE and as i said earlier ,  this cooling effect predominates .
SENTENCE now ,  what if there was a process that could control the type of clouds that form ?
SENTENCE are you talking about controlling the weather ?
SENTENCE well ,  i am not sure i would go that far .
SENTENCE but we recently noticed an increase in cloud cover over an area of the ocean waters around antarctica .
SENTENCE an increased area of low thick clouds ,  the type that reflects a lare portion of solar energy back to space and cools the earth .
SENTENCE well ,  the reason for this increased cloud cover ,  it turns out ,  is the exceptionally large amount of microscopic marine plants .
SENTENCE well ,  the current hypothesis is that these microorganisms produce a chemical ,  dimetho sulfide that interacts with the oxygen in the air ,  creating conditions that lead to the formation of the low thick clouds we observed .
SENTENCE well ,  that's true .
SENTENCE it could have huge implications .
SENTENCE so ,  maybe we are talking about controlling the weather .
SENTENCE perhaps ,  if the microorganisms near antarctica really are responsible ,  perhaps we can accelerate the process somehow .
